       "{'paragraph': 'Hong Kong has fallen into recession, hit by more than five months of anti-government protests that show no signs of relenting, and is unlikely to achieve annual economic growth this year, the city\\'s Financial Secretary said. \"The blow to our economy is comprehensive,\" Paul Chan said in a blog post on Sunday, adding that a preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday would show two successive quarters of contraction — the technical definition of a recession. He also said it would be \"extremely difficult\" to achieve the government\\'s pre-protest forecast of 0% to 1% annual economic growth. Protests in the former British colony have reached their 21st week. On Sunday, black-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets. Protesters have routinely torched store fronts and businesses including banks, particularly those owned by mainland Chinese companies and vandalized the city\\'s metro system MTR Corp as they view it as acting at the government\\'s behest to curtail protests. The MTR has shut services early for the past few weeks and said it will close around two hours earlier than normal on Monday by 11 p.m. to repair damaged facilities. Tourists numbers have plummeted, a decline Chan called an \"emergency\" with the drop in visitor numbers worsening in October, down nearly 50%. Retail operators, from prime shopping malls to mom and pop businesses, have been forced to shutter for multiple days over the past few months. While authorities have announced measures to support local small and medium seized enterprises, Chan said the measures could only \"slightly reduce the pressure\". \"Let citizens return to normal life, let industry and commerce to operate normally, and create more space for rational dialogue,\" he wrote. Protesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland. China denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.',\n",

       "\"Of the many major announcements Google made at its annual developer conference last week, from the debut of a connected jacket, to a smart home device to rival Amazon's Echo, one overshadowed them all: Daydream. Daydream, which will launch this fall as part of the newest version of Android, is Google's first high-quality virtual reality platform for mobile phones. It lumps all your phone's VR content into one app. You'll still need to wear a headset, and use a small remote control to navigate your virtual world, but Daydream should make interacting with apps in a virtual space feel as easy and natural as sending a text. YouTube, Google Photos, Street View, and other, non-Google apps, such as Netflix and Hulu, are being rebuilt for the platform — this isn't just something niche or exclusive to gamers. But that's the (near) future. There's already a lot of cool VR content you can enjoy today — even Coachella got in on the action. To do that, though, you still need a headset. Luckily, there are a few super affordable options you can grab to get accustomed to VR before Daydream lands this fall. I recently tested out three that work with your iPhone or Android phone: I Am Cardboard's EVA Virtual Reality Viewer (left, $25), the DSCVR Virtual Reality Viewer (above, $30), and Speck's recently released Pocket VR Viewer (below, $70). EVA, DSCVR, and the Pocket VR Viewer are all riffs on Google Cardboard, a novelty cardboard device that Google released in 2014. It lets anyone enter a virtual world for a mere $15. While all three variations that I tried serve their purpose — giving you the chance to experience virtual reality — I liked the $30 DSCVR viewer best. The headset is made of sturdy plastic, with a button in the upper-right corner that's useful for responding to commands on the accompanying Google Cardboard app. To get started using it, all you have to do is scan its QR code with your phone to connect the device with your phone, secure your phone in a slot in the front, and then look through the lens to start exploring Paris (or elsewhere).EVA is also easy to set up. It has a small, sliding controller on the left-hand side, as opposed to a button on top. The one downside here is that the viewer is made of foam. Yes, that made it more comfortable than the other options, but definitely not as sturdy. It kept falling apart in my hands after I placed my phone in front of the lens. Last was Speck's Pocket VR Viewer. The headset is an innovative way to bring your VR on the go — the viewer folds up so that it's flat. But when you insert your phone into the device, you don't just see the screen; you see the white edges around it. That's not a deal breaker, but it does detract from what's supposed to be a totally immersive viewing experience. Testing all three made it clear how essential a streamlined VR platform like Daydream is, and how major the technology could be if it delivers on its promise. While Daydream will only work with Android phones when it launches in the fall (prepare to have your iPhone loyalty tested), there's still a growing amount of VR content you can enjoy — on any smartphone — today. Just grab a cheap viewer and go for a (virtual) roller coaster ride.\""
