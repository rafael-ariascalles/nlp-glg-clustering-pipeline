            "\t LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Iran’s biggest OPEC rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are bagging its European oil market share by cranking up production of their lookalike crude grades before the restart of U.S. sanctions designed to halt exports from the Islamic Republic.  Iran faces curbs on its energy sector from early November after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away in May from a 2015 deal aimed at restraining Tehran’s nuclear program.  Iran’s crude is mainly bought by refiners in China, India, Japan and South Korea, although it has customers in Turkey and the European Union. Buyers seeking an alternative cannot simply opt for any crude on the market.   “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,” the International Energy Agency warned recently. [IEA/M]  “Thus, the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today,” the Paris-based IEA said.   A senior Iranian diplomat told producer group OPEC on Aug. 19 that no member country should be allowed to take over another’s share of oil exports, in light of Saudi Arabia’s offer to produce more to cover any Iranian shortfalls.  But a look at trade flows shows that in Europe at least, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have already succeeded in doing so.  Since the start of the year, Iranian flows to Europe have fallen 35 percent to around 415,000 barrels per day (bpd), while Saudi shipments have doubled and those from Iraq have risen 30 percent, according to Reuters flows and ship-tracking data.  “Saudi, Basra, Urals,” one refiner said when asked what crude grades were likely alternatives, the latter two hailing from Iraq and Russia respectively.  Iraq and Saudi Arabia have raised their oil output by a combined 245,000 bpd since the start of the year and cut the official selling prices for their light crudes for customers in Asia.  Iran is the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter and with as much as 1.5 million bpd of supply estimated to be under threat, its customers may be forced to pay handsomely for possible replacements.  Crude oil is categorized mainly according to sulfur content and its density relative to water, or American Petroleum Institute gravity. The denser crude is, the lower its gravity.   Crudes that have an API gravity above 35 degrees are categorized as “light”, while those with API gravity between 25 and 35 degrees are “medium” and below 25 degrees, “heavy”.   The lighter the crude, the easier and cheaper it is to extract and transport and the simpler it is to refine. Heavier crudes, which contain more impurities such as sulfur or metals, require additional processing to recover higher-value products.  Sulfur content is a second key category. A “sweet” crude is one with a sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent, while the sulfur content of a “sour” crude is above this threshold. Sulfur is corrosive and refineries that run more sour grades require more intense maintenance.  The average API for OPEC’s crudes is 33, compared with an average of 35.7 for U.S. grades. Shale, the fastest-growing type of U.S. crude, is lighter still.   (Graphic: Major crude oil grades by type - reut.rs/2OH67XX)  Iran Light is a medium sour crude, meaning that shale, however abundant and cheap, cannot act as a replacement on its own. Most refineries worldwide are tooled to run crudes with an API of 32, according to one source at a major European refiner.  (Graphic: EIA diagram of a conventional oil refinery - reut.rs/2L0yii9)  Refineries regularly blend different types of crude to get as close as possible to their optimal intake.   (Graphic: Major international crude oil grades - reut.rs/2OUtWeI)  The impact on the more sour crudes is already apparent. Prices for physical barrels oil have generally declined over the second half of this year, but Russian Urals, British Forties and Angolan Girassol, all sour, are the top-performing grades from around the Atlantic Basin, having lost around 4 percent.  That compares with losses of 5-6 percent for lighter, sweeter crudes such as Norwegian Ekofisk or Nigeria’s Bonny Light.

            "\t NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as concerns about trade friction between China and the United States prompted some safe-haven buying of the currency. China will ask the World Trade Organization (WTO) next week for permission to impose sanctions on the United States for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties. “The news with China is bad,” said Stan Shipley, strategist at ISI Evercore in New York. “It’s going to be a long time before it’s going to be settled.” Anxiety over the trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies outweighed optimism about a possible agreement on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union and reversed some of euro and sterling’s gains on Monday. The Australian dollar was another casualty of the trade tension between Beijing and Washington. The currency, seen as a proxy for global growth due to Australia’s export-oriented economy, tumbled to its weakest level against the greenback since February 2016. Still, there were encouraging signs that the Trump administration is moving toward resolving its trade issues with Canada and Europe, Shipley said. Higher share prices on Wall Street also boosted the greenback, with the S&P 500 index up 0.46 percent. The dollar index that tracks the greenback against six major currencies was up 0.09 percent at 95.239. It had shed more than 0.2 percent on Monday as the euro and sterling bounced after the European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier hinted at a possible Brexit deal. The euro was underpinned by a decline in Italian government borrowing costs after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria on Monday predicted that yields would drop as the government lays out its eagerly awaited 2019 budget. The euro initially rose 0.4 percent to $1.16445 before turning lower in early U.S. trading. It later pared those losses to be little changed on the day at $1.15865 following a German magazine Der Spiegel report that said the executives of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank were growing more open to the idea of a merger. Sterling touched a five-week high against the dollar earlier on Tuesday before fading to $1.2989, down 0.3 percent on the day, according to Reuters data. The Australian dollar was down 0.16 percent to $0.71010 after hitting its lowest since February 2016 on concerns that any damage to the Chinese economy from a trade war could hurt Australia’s exporters. The New Zealand dollar also hovered near a 2-1/2-year low at $0.6507. China’s offshore yuan fell 0.2 percent to 6.8673, a 2-1/2-week low.

            "\t * Dollar/yen off 2-week high, euro flat * Trump says U.S.-China deal close Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Major currencies hardly budged on Wednesday as traders looked ahead to the final outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and a shortened holiday week in the United States. Against the yen the dollar was traded at 109.05 yen, off two-week high of 109.205 touched on Tuesday amid mild optimism that Washington and Beijing could soon sign a deal to put a hold on their 16-month trade spat. The euro stood at $1.1023, little changed so far this week. Trade is slowing down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday in the U.S., before which some major players will have wind down most of their trade for the year. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Washington was in the \"final throes\" of work on a deal that would defuse a 16-month trade war with Beijing. But he also underscored Washington's support for protesters in Hong Kong, a potential huge sore point with China. His remarks followed a telephone call on Tuesday by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with Chinese Vice Premier Liu that was disclosed by China's Commerce Ministry. Although Trump's comments kept the bullish mood in the U.S. stock market alive, major currencies were on hold, with many market participants now hesitant to make big bets before they see the actual deal. \"Judging from Trump's comments, an agreement will have to wait at least until the weekend,\" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale in Tokyo. One major sticking point has been the rollback of tariffs Trump has imposed, with Beijing demanding they be scrapped as a part of the deal. The United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a dispute over trade practices that the U.S. government says are unfair. China has responded in kind with its own tariffs on U.S. goods. \"I think markets are betting that a likely compromise will be to continue to negotiate on tariffs. If that turns out to be the case, we could see buy-on-rumor-sell-on-fact type of selling in the dollar/yen,\" he added. If both sides cannot reach an agreement soon, the next important date to watch is Dec. 15, when Washington is scheduled to impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods. \"The market is believing that the December tariffs won't be activated,\" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank. With markets preoccupied with the trade issues, soft U.S. consumer sentiment data hardly made any dent in the dollar. U.S. consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November despite expectations of a small rebound, amid worries about current business conditions and employment prospects. Another report on Tuesday showed an unexpected drop in new home sales last month, but data for September was revised higher to show purchases hitting their highest level in over 12 years.

            "\t WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea has told the United States for the first time that it is prepared to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets President Donald Trump, a U.S. official said on Sunday.  U.S. and North Korean officials have held secret contacts recently in which Pyongyang directly confirmed its willingness to hold the unprecedented summit, the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  The communications, still at a preliminary stage, have involved State Department officials talking to North Korea apparently through its United Nations mission, and intelligence officers from both sides using a separate backchannel, the official said.  Until now, the United States had relied mostly on ally South Korea’s assurance of Kim’s intentions.  South Korean envoys visited Washington last month to convey Kim’s invitation to meet. Trump, who has exchanged bellicose threats with Kim in the past year, surprised the world by quickly agreeing to meet Kim to discuss the crisis over Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States.  But North Korea has not broken its public silence on the summit, which U.S. officials say is being planned for May. There was no immediate word on the possible venue for the talks, which would be the first ever between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader.  The U.S. official declined to say exactly when the U.S.-North Korea communications had taken place but said the two sides had held multiple direct contacts.  “The U.S. has confirmed that Kim Jong Un is willing to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula‎,” said a second U.S. official.  South Korea’s presidential Blue House welcomed the communication between North Korea and the United States, with one official saying the development was “positive”.  “We are aware contact between North Korea and the United States is going well,” said another Blue House official on condition of anonymity.  “We don’t know, however, up to what extent information is being shared between the two.”  On Monday, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton is due to begin his role as Trump’s national security adviser, while on Thursday Senate confirmation hearings begin for Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state. Both have taken hawkish stances on North Korea.  The second South Korean official said the South’s National Security Office head, Chung Eui-yong, could speak with Bolton over the telephone as early as Tuesday.  Questions remain about how North Korea would define denuclearization, which Washington sees as Pyongyang abandoning its nuclear weapons program.  North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.  Some analysts have said Trump’s willingness to meet Kim handed North Korea a diplomatic win, as the United States had insisted for years that any such summit be preceded by North Korean steps to denuclearize.  Tension over North Korea’s tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action against Pyongyang.  But anxieties have eased significantly since North Korea sent athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. The neighbors are technically still at war after a 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce.   North and South Korea will hold their first summit in more than a decade towards the end of April.  The two Koreas have been holding working talks since March to work out details of the summit, like the agenda and security for the two leaders.  Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a surprise visit to Beijing in late March, his first trip outside the isolated North Korea since he came to power in 2011.

            "\t President TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE is making a serious roll of the dice with his decision to meet face-to-face with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump would be the first U.S. president to ever meet with a leader of North Korea, and success in the negotiations — if the Korean peninsula was denuclearized — would be a tremendous, historic achievement. At the same time, there’s little reason to believe Kim has actually changed his mind about nuclear weapons when he’s on the verge of achieving his goal of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. While GOP lawmakers said Kim’s offering of a meeting was proof that Trump’s policies are having some success, they also urged caution going forward. In Friday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders appeared to give the administration wiggle room to cancel the meeting, attaching conditions that were not announced Thursday night. “We’re not going to have this meeting take place until we see concrete actions that match the words and the rhetoric of North Korea,” Sanders said. “We’ve accepted the invitation to talk based on them following through with concrete actions on the promises that they’ve made.” That followed Secretary of State Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonState Dept. extends travel ban to North Korea Scaramucci breaks up with Trump in now-familiar pattern Senate braces for brawl over Trump's spy chief MORE’s comments Friday morning seeking to make a distinction between talks and negotiations. On Thursday, Tillerson, who is traveling in Africa, said “we’re a long ways from negotiations” hours before the announcement was made. “President Trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would willingly meet with Kim Jong Un when conditions were right and the time was right,” Tillerson said Friday in Djibouti. “And I think in the president’s judgment, that time has arrived now. So there’s no — in my comments yesterday, I was indicating comments about negotiations, but we’ve been open for talks for some time.” Trump sees himself as the ultimate deal-maker. An agreement with Kim in which North Korea abandoned its nuclear ambitions would deliver an achievement that multiple presidents have failed to reach. “It’s really a high-stakes poker game, and you can either win big or perhaps get taken to the cleaners,” said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA division chief for the Koreas who is now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, said both Trump and Kim risk looking foolish if they don’t walk away with something. “There’s something that’s going to be achieved if they get together or it’s not going to happen,” he said. “It’s too much of a risk for both sides.” North Korea has negotiated with the United States before, only to walk away once winning sanctions relief and other concessions. It’s a pitfall lawmakers have been reminding Trump about since Thursday’s announcement. “We can pursue more diplomacy as we keep applying pressure ounce by ounce,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed RoyceEdward (Ed) Randall RoyceMystery surrounds elusive sanctions on Russia Hillicon Valley: Lawmakers struggle to understand Facebook's Libra project | EU hits Amazon with antitrust probe | New cybersecurity concerns over census | Robocall, election security bills head to House floor | Privacy questions over FaceApp House panel advances bill to protect elections from foreign interference MORE (R-Calif.) said in a statement. “Remember, North Korean regimes have repeatedly used talks and empty promises to extract concessions and buy time. North Korea uses this to advance its nuclear and missile programs. We’ve got to break this cycle.” Administration officials insist Trump will not fall into that trap. “The North Koreans are coming to the table despite the United States making zero concessions and, in close coordination with our allies, we have consistently increased the pressure on the Kim regime,” Vice President Pence said in a statement Friday. “Our resolve is undeterred and our policy remains the same: all sanctions remain in place and the maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear program.” Kazianis said the meeting could be a good idea if three conditions are true. The first is that the meeting should not take place in North Korea. Kazianis suggested having it at the demilitarized zone between the Koreas. Second, he said, the maximum pressure campaign should continue. And third, joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises should go on as planned. Still, he said, Kim will probably get at least a little propaganda victory just by meeting with Trump. “He’s going to get some great photo ops, but when history calls, you’ve got to answer the bell,” Kazianis said. Klingner, though, said the meeting risks giving Kim the same sort of the propaganda win the Trump administration was worried about him getting during the North Korean delegation’s “charm offensive” at the Winter Olympics. Trump, he said, “impetuously and prematurely” accepted the invitation without getting concessions from Kim, such as progress on freeing the three Americans detained in North Korea or evidence of Kim’s sincerity in denuclearizing. “If the first time a president meets with the North Koreans is the highest coin in the diplomatic realm, you don’t want to spend that too quickly,” he said. It’s possible Trump’s business acumen could yield positive results, Klingner said. But the situation reminded him of the arguments in favor of sending former President Clinton to meet with Kim Jong Il in 2000 — that the force of his personality would cause Kim to buckle. The foreign policy establishment’s majority view that that would be a bad idea won out, and Clinton never met with the leader while in office. To mitigate risk now that the meeting has been agreed to, Klingner said, U.S. and North Korean officials need extensive discussions to agree to parameters for the summit. But even that could run into pitfalls. “Even if you have that kind of detail planned … someone can throw out the playbook as soon as they walk into the room,” Klingner said. “Trump may not abide by it. Supporters will say that’s what makes him effective.” View the discussion thread.

            "\t Gold prices surged to their highest in more than five years on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a possible interest rate cut as early as next month, pressuring U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar. Spot gold was up 1.7% at $1,382.61 per ounce, after hitting its highest since March 17, 2014 at $1,386.38 earlier. Gold prices have gained about $80 so far this month. U.S. gold futures jumped 2.8% to $1,386.30 an ounce, after touching their highest since April 2018 at $1,397.70. \"The driver for the surge is obviously the Fed delivering the dovish tilt that the market was looking for. It removed the 'patience' approach to cutting rates,\" said Saxo Bank commodity strategist Ole Hansen said. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July, saying it is ready to battle growing global and domestic economic risks as it took stock of rising trade tensions and growing concerns about weak inflation. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies. The Fed's rate signal came before meetings at other major central banks in Asia and Europe that were expected to flag similar moves. The European Central Bank and the Australian central bank had signalled this week more policy stimulus was needed. \"The main reason why we are seeing interest rate expectations being reduced so dramatically is because economic data is not moving up to previous strength and that has also raised questions of how much further stock markets could continue to benefit from these rate cuts,\" Hansen said. Even though the U.S. central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for now, the shift in the Fed's view since its last policy meeting weighed on the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields. \"The (gold's) move higher looks constructive for a further test toward $1,400 as participants focus upon the Fed's dovish skew, with potential targets extending toward $1,450 should near-term support around $1,375 remain intact,\" MKS PAMP Group said in a note. Meanwhile, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday top Chinese and U.S. officials would resume trade talks in accordance with the wishes of their leaders, but China hopes the United States will create the necessary conditions for dialogue. \"The short term headwinds (for gold) will be if we see a trade deal being reached between U.S. and China that may just ease some of the worries about global growth and also the need for the rates to be cut aggressively,\" Saxo Bank's Hansen said. Silver rose 1.4% to $15.37 per ounce, while platinum climbed 1% to $818.71 per ounce. Palladium gained 1.3% to $1,520.54 per ounce, having hit a 12-week high of $1,531.38 earlier in the session.\n",

Weak Chinese manufacturing data on Monday underscored the challenges for the world economy, while volatility in oil and other assets fueled interest in gold as a haven from market turmoil. Spot gold touched $1,130.30 an ounce early on Tuesday, its strongest since Nov. 3, and was little changed at $1,128.31 at 3:10 p.m. EST (2010 GMT). U.S. gold for April delivery settled down 0.07 percent at $1,127.20 an ounce. Traders noted some long liquidation pushed spot prices to a session low of $1,122.04 an ounce after failing to hold above the 200-day moving average at $1,129.49. “In the near term gold is finding some support in the dovish tone from central banks last week, notably the Fed and the Bank of Japan,” said Jens Pedersen, senior analyst at Danske Bank. Gold, which as a non-yielding asset tends to rise on ultra-low rates, benefited from the Bank of Japan’s introduction last week of negative interest rates and increasing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise rates as many times as previously expected in 2016. However, gold prices have been capped to the upside as the Fed has kept the door open for a rate increase in March. “It is perfectly possible that it will move towards $1,150 (in coming weeks) and then it will depend on the equity markets,” said Carsten Menke, an analyst at Julius Baer. “Clearly this is an environment that is supportive for gold in the short term.” Reflecting growing confidence in gold, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 21.9 million ounces on Monday, the most since Nov. 3. For palladium, more ETF outflows are likely in the coming months after subdued industrial activity globally caused liquidation, taking holdings to the lowest since mid-2014, UBS Wealth Management Research said in a note. In a London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) survey, analysts were bullish the four precious metals, calling for the average price of gold in 2016 to be up 1.1 percent from 2015 at $1,103 an ounce. In silver and platinum they forecast 5.4 percent rises to $14.74 and $911 respectively, and a 12.7 percent increase in palladium to $568. Spot silver was down 0.3 percent at $14.28, platinum was down 1.7 percent at $855.11 an ounce, and palladium was down 2.3 percent at $488.62.

            "\t LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling jumped on Wednesday, rebounding off a two-week low, after a Bloomberg report that the United Kingdom and Germany were prepared to drop a key sticking point on Brexit negotiations fuelled hopes of a breakthrough in talks. Investors rushed to buy the currency after the report, lifting it nearly one percent to a three-day high of $1.2983. From trough to peak, sterling has rallied more than 1.2 percent on an intraday basis as the latest headlines prompted investors to cut short bets. Against the euro EURGBP=D3, the British currency rallied half a percent to 89.65 pence. The currency had been struggling earlier around $1.2787. “Sterling had a jump on stories suggesting there is a shift in the German government on Brexit demands, making it more likely that there could be an agreement,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX Strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. “That’s taken some of the risk premium out of sterling.” Bloomberg quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that Germany would be ready to accept a less detailed agreement on the U.K.’s future economic and trade ties with the EU in a bid to get a Brexit deal done. The UK was also willing to settle for a vaguer statement of intent on the future relationship, postponing some decisions until after Brexit day, according to an official quoted in the report Jordan Rochester, an economist at Nomura, said the latest media reports would reduce market concerns of a hard Brexit for now and encourage hopes of a transition period which should be positive for sterling in the near term. The pound has weakened since hitting a near one-month high of $1.3043 at the end of August on weak economic data, doubts over Prime Minister Theresa May’s leadership and opposition from the European Union to Britain’s proposals for exiting the bloc. That had raised fears the country would crash out of the EU without a trade deal in place, which many economists warn would be disastrous for an already struggling economy. A survey this week had showed weaker than expected growth in Britain’s construction sector in August. All that had prompted investors to build up short positions against the British currency to more than one-year highs. “It seems the latest news is lifting another obstacle for sterling but we need to see concrete progress before sterling reaches towards the 2018 highs,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING in London. British government bond yields also rose, with 10-year yields up 4.1 basis points at 1.47 percent GB10YT=RR. But market watchers warned against reading too much into the latest reports as a widening selloff in emerging markets due to a resurgent dollar on escalating trade war fears should check gains. As fears grew that the United States may be preparing to go ahead with imposing a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods when a public consultation period ends on Thursday, the dollar advanced against its major rivals and emerging market currencies. The dollar’s more than 6 percent rise against its rivals over the past six months has hit emerging market currencies hard.

            "\t LONDON (Reuters) - The British pound extended losses on Tuesday, plunging through technical support levels to a one-month low against the dollar as traders became increasingly nervous about Britain crashing out of the European Union at the end of the month. Broad-based dollar strength also contributed to the falls, analysts said. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson expected to soon present his proposals for an amended Brexit agreement, investors questioned the likelihood of Brussels finally signing a divorce deal with the United Kingdom. “There’s no reason (for sterling) to go up unless the EU says yes we can negotiate on this,” said Kenneth Broux, corporate FX strategist at Societe Generale, adding that the pound could fall to $1.20. By 1415 GMT, it was down 0.6% at $1.2228 GBP=D3, having briefly dipped to a four-week low of $1.2205. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.7% at 89.21 pence EURGBP=D3 after sliding to a 2-1/2-week low of 89.345 pence. More than three years after the 2016 Brexit referendum, Britain is heading towards an Oct. 31 departure date without a clear understanding of whether it will leave with a deal, without a deal or even leave by the deadline. The government’s proposals are expected to include new ideas that remove the contested insurance policy for the Irish border that Britain previously signed up to, but EU officials sounded sceptical about the chances of a breakthrough. Moreover, Ireland dismissed reported ideas including physical checks on goods at a distance from the border itself. “The market has seen these kinds of headlines before and then we get a push back, so there is some scepticism about what we will see,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, referring to the expected government proposals for the backstop. “That leaves sterling in a choppy range and there is plenty of news flow this week,” Foley said. Broad-based gains for the dollar on renewed evidence of strength in the U.S. economy contributed to the earlier slide in the pound. Chartists said earlier in the day they were watching the $1.2279 level, the 50-day moving average - a technical indicator that refers to the currency’s average closing price over the past 50 days. A conclusive breach below that level would open the door to further losses, they said. The latest UK economic data had little immediate impact on the British currency. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index showed the factory sector overall shrank for a fifth month in a row, its longest decline since mid-2009.

            "\t * Upbeat China data boosts sentiment * Oil flirts with key, long-term technical break * JP Morgan, bank stocks in focus By Jamie McGeever LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Wednesday after surprisingly upbeat Chinese trade data offered hope Asia’s biggest economy is finally stabilising, boosting risk appetite. A strong rise in European bank shares, led by renewed optimism surrounding Italy’s fund to shore up weak lenders, and a positive reaction to JP Morgan’s first quarter earnings also lifted broader indices. Europe’s FTSEuroFirst index of leading 300 shares posted its biggest gain in a month, rising 2.1 percent to a two-week high of 1,334 points, and Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC also rose more than 2 percent . U.S. futures pointed to a rise of 0.6 percent at the open on Wall Street. “China’s trade data beat expectations, which lent further support to risk sentiment today as reflected in the bounce in equity markets,” Morgan Stanley strategists said. China reported exports jumped 11.5 percent year on year in March — the first increase since June, well above market forecasts, and a huge improvement on February. Chinese stocks added 1.4 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 2.8 percent for its biggest daily gain in six weeks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 1.7 percent, marking its sixth straight gain and longest winning streak in six months. Financials led the rally in Europe, with the region’s main banking index up more than 5 percent as investors welcomed assurances from Italy’s economy minister that European authorities won’t block the country’s bank fund. Investors also gave a thumbs up to JP Morgan’s first quarter earnings. Net profit fell to $5.5 billion, but earnings per share and revenue beat expectations, and its shares were up nearly 3 percent in pre-market trading. Oil prices, however, ran into profit-taking after having rallied almost 20 percent in the last week. Brent crude was down 1.5 percent at $44.02 a barrel, after breaching the 200-day moving average around $43.50 on Tuesday — the first time it has scaled this key technical level in almost two years. U.S. crude lost nearly 2 percent to $41.40, easing back from a four-month high, but also held above the 200-day moving average around $40.95 as attention turns to this weekend’s meeting of top oil producers in Doha. Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi ruled out an output cut, in comments to Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper published on Wednesday. A rally in energy stocks helped Wall Street end Tuesday firmer across the board . The S&P 500 energy sector jumped 2.8 percent and the Dow industrials posted its best day in about a month. The lift in energy overnight boosted oil- and commodity-sensitive currencies including the Canadian and Australian dollars to multi-month peaks, but that rally fizzled out as oil headed lower again. Both currencies were down around 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar , which was in turn up two thirds of a percent at 109.20 yen, having climbed from a near 18-month trough around 107.63 set on Monday. The euro fell two thirds of a percent against the dollar to $1.1307, helping the dollar index to climb two thirds of a percent to 94.584 and further away from its near eight-month low of 93.627 struck recently. “Markets are trading ‘risk on’, buoyed by better than expected China trade data. In sympathy the dollar is bouncing back versus the euro and yen, and in the near-term we think this correction can extend further,” BNP Paribas currency strategists said. Short-term fair value for the euro is around $1.1243, they said. U.S. Treasury bond yields rose as much as 2 basis points across the curve, notably at the short end, while the dollar’s strength helped drive gold down more than 1 percent to $1,241 an ounce.

            "\t SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Japan's benchmark share index rose to its highest in 15 months on Friday, as hopes for rebounding global demand and a softer yen drove broad-based gains. The Nikkei 225 Index rose half a percentage point to touch its highest level since October 2018 and has added more than 1% this year. The broader Topix was 0.4% stronger. \"When you look at Japan, you're not just looking at Japan. Half of earnings at Japanese companies are non-Japanese, so there is a big international story,\" said Jim McCafferty, Joint Head of APAC Equity Research at Nomura in Hong Kong. \"As we go into earnings season we are probably going to get guidance from a number of companies that point to a strengthening in global demand.\" The formal signing of the Sino-U.S. trade agreement on Wednesday and the recent easing of tensions in the Middle East have removed uncertainty and fired hopes for a revival in global growth and demand. Chinese economic data released on Friday, while subdued for the year, included an unexpected jump in factory output and solid retail sales in December, suggesting the world's second biggest economy ended the year on a firmer note. Optimism has also pushed the safe-haven Japanese yen to an almost eight-month low - a boon for exporters. The dollar last traded at 110.23 yen, up 0.08 % during the session. Gains were spread across all sectors of the market, with 167 advancers on the Nikkei index against 46 decliners. Growth-exposed exporters, such as construction-equipment maker Komatsu Ltd, led manufacturing gains, rising 1.5% to a two-week high. Firms such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Sony also made advances. The largest percentage gainers in the index were industrial instrument maker Yokogawa Electric Corp, up 4.32%, followed by power-supply equipment maker Fuji Electric Co Ltd , gaining 4.28 % and logistics firm Yamato Holdings Co Ltd, up 3.44%. Financials found support, too, after Morgan Stanley overnight capped a solid set of fourth-quarter results from Wall Street's big banks this week, boding well for their Japanese peers. Nomura Holdings rose 1%, while Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group also gained. (Reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n",

Suncor Energy rose 1.1 percent to C$44.26, while Encana Corp saw a 3.6 percent lift to end at C$15.63. Cenovus Energy added 3.9 percent to close at C$13.01. The three companies were among the index’s most influential drivers and helped lift the overall energy sector to its fifth day of gains. The group, which was up 1.5 percent, has advanced more than 8 percent over that period. Oil and gas companies were powered by crude prices, which touched their highest since mid-2015 earlier in the session. The commodity gave up those gains, however, after weekly U.S. government inventory data showed the latest crude stock draw was less than what an industry trade group had reported. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index finished up 3.74 points at its highest-ever close at 16,029.33. The index rose as high as 16,105.88 during the session, for its fourth-straight intraday record and was on track for its eighth straight week of gains. Six of the index’s 10 biggest groups lost ground. “We continue to see risk appetite staying healthy for equities,” said Kash Pashootan, chief executive and chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc. “You have to be cautious in how you play this market. You have to build some defense in the portfolio, but not too much defense,” added Pashootan, whose portfolio has a 12 percent weighting in cash and 5 percent in gold. Hudson’s Bay Co ended 9.1 percent higher at C$12.29 after it confirmed a Reuters report that Karstadt owner Signa had made an unsolicited offer for HBC’s European Kaufhof chain. Industrials were down 0.8 percent, with Air Canada and WestJet Airlines both slumping more than 5.5 percent. Air Canada ended at C$24.10, while WestJet finished at C$25.50. Some analysts cut their WestJet price target and forecast on a disappointing outlook. Shopify Inc fell 3.6 percent to 123.68, extending its post-earnings losses.

Beijing on Thursday welcomed an invitation from Washington for a fresh round of talks. But the timing of the proposed talks remains unclear, with President Donald Trump saying that the United States was under no pressure to make a deal.

            "\t   President Trump added fuel to the fire engulfing his White House on Friday by warning now-fired FBI Director James Comey not to reveal anything about their conversations. In an early-morning tweetstorm Friday, Trump suggested there might be recordings of his conversations with Comey that could be used to undercut anything the former director might tell the public. “James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted.  The stunning pronouncement gave more ammunition to critics who say Trump fired Comey to thwart his bureau’s investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.  Later Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to say whether Trump secretly recorded his conversations with Comey — or has done so with any other White House visitors, including members of Congress and foreign dignitaries. “I’ve talked to the president. The president has nothing further to add on that,\" Spicer told reporters. Democrats quickly demanded that Trump turn over any tapes, if they exist. “For a president who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering,” said Rep. Adam SchiffAdam Bennett SchiffAre Democrats turning Trump-like? Schiff offers bill to make domestic terrorism a federal crime New intel chief inherits host of challenges MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. “The president should immediately provide any such recordings to Congress or admit, once again, to have made a deliberately misleading — and in this case threatening — statement,” he added. The remark deepened the sense of crisis surrounding the White House since Trump’s dismissal of Comey on Tuesday evening.  His suggestion that he taped conversations with Comey played right into the hands of critics who were already comparing his actions to that of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Nixon secretly monitored visitors at the White House complex and Camp David using an elaborate recording system, which was ultimately exposed in 1973 and helped lead to his downfall. No president is known to have used such a system since. Trump has also vented his frustration with media coverage focusing on the White House’s often-contradictory accounts of how and why he decided to fire the FBI director amid the active Russia investigation.  The president has rarely been seen at the White House this week, but in his first question-and-answer session about Comey’s firing, he contradicted accounts offered by his press team and Vice President Pence that he acted on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  Trump told NBC News on Thursday that the decision was his alone and he would have fired Comey “regardless of the recommendation” from Rosenstein.  The president also suggested that the Russia investigation had played a part in firing Comey, something his aides had vehemently denied.  “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story,’ ” he said. “It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won. ... This was an excuse for having lost an election.”  Those comments, plus another Friday tweet claiming his aides can’t be expected to convey his views with “perfect accuracy,” raised new questions about the credibility of his top spokespeople: Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Clearly frustrated, the president on Friday threatened to scrap the daily White House briefings for reporters.  Asked by host Jeanine Pirro if he’s moving too fast for his press team, Trump replied, “yes.” “We don’t have press conferences ... just don’t have them,” the president said. “Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don’t have them. I think it’s a good idea.”  At the same time, he defended Spicer, whose job is said to be in jeopardy. “Well he’s doing a good job but he gets beat up.” “Again you know they don’t show the 90 questions that they asked and answered properly,” Trump continued. “I’m saying if they’re off just a little bit, just a little bit, it’s the big story.” Spicer and Sanders have been tasked with rebutting damaging leaks of Comey’s conversations with Trump, including reports that the president demanded the director’s personal loyalty during a late January dinner. This week’s events have made their task harder; Sanders conceded Wednesday that at least one discrepancy in the dueling accounts of Comey’s firing happened because she did not speak with the president. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip style has served him well in the past, and especially during the 2016 campaign, when he was able to keep his foes on the defensive.   But Trump’s unpredictability has at time inflicted damage to his presidency, and is now putting him in dangerous legal waters. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal ethics watchdog, on Friday called on the Justice Department to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey. “That tweet shows very, very poor judgment,” said Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush and CREW board vice chairman. “I don’t think he did anything illegal with the tweet. If he is trying to influence Comey’s possible testimony to Congress, however, then he could get into serious trouble.” Comey declined an invitation to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, but leaders of the panel still hope to bring him in on another date. Lauren Ouziel, a Temple University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said not enough facts are known to determine whether obstruction occurred, but that Trump’s firing of Comey combined with his “threat” on Twitter should be enough to pique the interest of investigators. “There’s enough there that makes it worth looking into, based on what’s been publicly reported,” she said. “It raises a significant question as to whether obstruction took place.” Spicer on Friday insisted the tweet was “not a threat.” “He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself,\" he said. Ouziel said Trump’s conduct with regard to Comey “clearly amounts to an egregious flouting of the constitutional norms of the office of the presidency, and an abuse of the power of that office.” Comey hasn’t spoken publicly since his surprise firing Tuesday. But those who know him have told news outlets he’s confident any recording of the conversation would reflect well on him. “He hopes there are tapes,” one Comey confidant told NBC News. “That would be perfect.” View the discussion thread.

            "\t * Euro eases after rallying about 3 pct since mid-Dec * Dollar index steady, stays above Tuesday’s 3-1/2 month low * Near-term focus on coming Fed minutes and U.S. data (Updates prices, adds comments) By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The euro eased on Wednesday to take a breather from a rally prompted by optimism over the euro zone’s economy and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its bond-buying stimulus in 2018. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2048. The currency hit a four-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday, marking a gain of roughly 3 percent from a mid-December trough and bringing it close to a September high of $1.2092, the currency’s highest level since early 2015. It was boosted by data showing euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades as rising demand suggested they will start the new year on a high. The euro was also supported by expectations for a shift in ECB monetary policy this year. The ECB board member in charge of the central bank’s market operations, Benoit Coeure, said at the weekend that he saw a “reasonable chance” bond purchases would not be extended beyond September. ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper in an interview that the ECB may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continued to grow strongly. “It’s this monetary policy normalisation everywhere that’s playing catch-up to the Fed, and that’s why the dollar is weak,” said Heng Koon How, head of market strategy for United Overseas Bank in Singapore. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies held steady at 91.902, having pulled up from Tuesday’s 3-1/2 month low of 91.751. Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017. Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday. “One key is whether the Fed minutes and U.S. jobs data will prompt the U.S. 10-year bond yield to clearly rise above 2.5 percent,” said Teppei Ino, an analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore, which would boost the dollar. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was 2.465 percent at the close of U.S. trade on Tuesday, below a nine-month high of 2.504 percent on Dec. 21. Commodity-linked currencies took a breather from a rally spurred in recent weeks by higher metal and oil prices. The Canadian dollar last stood at C$1.2521 per U.S. dollar.

            "\t The dollar rose on Tuesday, bolstered by an expected interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve this week and helped by political risks in Europe amid Dutch and French elections that have pressured European currencies. \"Sentiment remains firmly bullish towards the greenback with further gains expected as speculators bet on the Federal Reserve raising U.S. interest rates repeatedly this year,\" said Britain-based research analyst Lukman Otunuga at online currency broker FXTM. The Fed starts a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures have priced in a 95 percent chance the Fed will nudge rates higher on Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, climbed 0.2 percent to 101.54. Also buoying the dollar's outlook, data showed that U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in February and the year-on-year gain was the largest in nearly five years. In particular, a key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.3 percent in February, the biggest gain since April 2016. The so-called core PPI rose 0.2 percent in January. The euro, which hit a five-week high on Monday above $1.07 on expectations the European Central Bank is moving towards winding back its stimulus program, fell 0.2 percent to $1.0636 on caution ahead of the Dutch vote. That extended falls from the previous day on comments by ECB officials that were seen as relatively dovish. The Netherlands will vote on Wednesday in an election that is seen as a fresh test of the anti-immigrant, populist politics that swept across the West in 2016. Polls suggest the government may lose about half its seats while the anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) party of Geert Wilders surges. Though Wilders has little chance of winning enough seats to form a government, a PVV win would send shock waves across Europe. Sterling, meanwhile, slipped 0.5 percent to $1.2151, after earlier falling to an eight-week low, on worries about a possible second Scottish independence referendum and the triggering of Article 50, which will formally begin the negotiations that will take Britain out of the EU. Investors also have their eyes on the Trump administration's fiscal 2018 federal budget plan, which will be released on Thursday, and a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Germany on Friday.\n",

The filing includes a memo signed by FBI special agent Jeffrey Weiland, who participated in a dozen proffer sessions with Manafort in September and October, while he was cooperating in Mueller’s investigation. The document said Manafort also twice testified before a grand jury. Mueller's team released a 31-page memo signed by Weiland and 157 pages of evidence, much of which is redacted. It cites text messages, emails and tax documents as evidence that Manafort lied about various topics in the course of his meetings with government officials. The filing comes nearly two months after Mueller accused Manafort of lying in breach of his plea agreement. Manafort’s attorneys last week contested the accusations, saying their client told the truth “to the best of his ability” and did not deliberately lie to investigators. They suggested his time in jail had affected his mental and physical wellbeing. Manafort was ensnared in Mueller’s investigation on charges related to his foreign lobbying. The former Trump campaign aide agreed to cooperate in the probe into Russian interference and potential coordination between the campaign and Moscow in September, before his plea deal collapsed. The special counsel has accused Manafort of making false statements about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business associate suspected of ties to Russian intelligence; Kilimnik’s involvement in a witness tampering scheme; Manafort’s contacts with the administration; a $125,000 payment made to a company working for Manafort; and a separate Justice Department investigation. FBI agents said in Tuesday’s filing that Manafort gave multiple explanations for the $125,000 payment made in June 2017. The document also says that prosecutors possess “documentary evidence” that Manafort made false statements when he denied having direct or indirect contacts with Trump administration officials. This includes a May 26, 2018, text message exchange in which an unnamed third party asked Manafort, “If I see POTUS one on one next week am I ok to remind him of our relationship?” It says Manafort responded by saying, “[y]es” and “[e]ven if not one on one.” The document also says that Richard Gates, Manafort’s onetime business partner and a former Trump campaign aide, told investigators in debriefings that Manafort informed him he was using “intermediaries” to “get people appointed in the administration.” The intermediaries are not named. “Evidence demonstrates that Manafort had contacts, and tried to have contacts, through others, with the Administration,” the document says. The document appears to say that Manafort testified before the grand jury about his administration contacts, but that portion is heavily redacted. The FBI official in his declaration said that Manafort gave shifting explanations about his contacts with Kilimnik as well as his role in efforts to obstruct the investigation. The section about Manafort’s interactions with Kilimnik is heavily redacted, stating that Manafort gave “various accounts” of his communications with him about an unknown subject “over the course of several interviews and in the grand jury.”   Another section says Manafort gave different versions of events surrounding an incident in another DOJ investigation. “One version that was more incriminating was given prior to signing the plea agreement (on Sept. 13, 2018) and another that was more benign was made after on Oct. 5, 2018 after his plea deal,” agents said. “When confronted with the inconsistency by the government and his own counsel, Manafort largely redacted the second version.” Manafort’s defense team made a major error last week when they filed redacted court documents that did not shield the information from the public. By copying and pasting the blacked-out portions into a new file, reporters were able to see that Mueller had accused Manafort of sharing polling data during the 2016 presidential campaign with Kilimnik. The error also revealed that an unnamed third party texted Manafort last May to ask permission to use Manafort’s name as a point of introduction if the person met with Trump. Manafort’s defense team has not yet requested a hearing to settle the dispute over whether the plea deal has been breached. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the federal district court in Washington, D.C. has set a tentative hearing for Jan. 25. Lydia Wheeler contributed to this report. View the discussion thread.

            "\t Rick Gates’ cooperation with prosecutors investigating President Donald Trump and his 2016 campaign paid off Tuesday when a federal judge sentenced the GOP operative to 45 days of weekend jail time and three years of probation. The relatively light punishment for Gates, a former Trump campaign deputy, was still slightly more than expected going into the hearing.  Federal prosecutors last week had recommended just one year of probation for Gates in exchange for his role as a critical high-profile government witness whose testimony helped net convictions against two of Trump’s ex-campaign aides — former chairman Paul Manafort and longtime political adviser Roger Stone. Gates, 47, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to a broad financial conspiracy with Manafort, as well a separate charge of lying to investigators. But in a bid for a less stringent sentence, Gates agreed to sit for more than 500 hours with federal and state prosecutors both before and after he officially flipped on Trump and his allies. Gates' recollections later became an essential part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report detailing how Trump and his 2016 campaign prepped for the release of stolen Democratic emails at critical moments of the last White House race. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Tuesday that she’d been struggling with how to handle Gates’ eventual sentencing. She noted she’d seen him testify twice in her courtroom and found him \"extremely candid” in addressing questions from prosecutors. \"He did not appear to embroider,” the judge said. “He didn't come across as some kind of bought-and-paid-for puppet.”  Just a week after Attorney General Bill Barr declared the Mueller investigation was based on a “completely bogus narrative,” Jackson used her perch on Tuesday to deliver what sounded like a pointed, public rebuttal, saying there was “an ample basis” for an aggressive inquiry into the Trump campaign aides’ connections and actions. “Gates’ information alone warranted, indeed demanded, further investigation from the standpoint of our national security, the integrity of our elections and the enforcement of our criminal laws,” Jackson declared. An appointee of President Barack Obama, she has presided over more of the criminal prosecutions stemming from the Mueller probe than any other judge. Before handing down Gates’ sentence, which also included a $20,000 fine and 300 hours of community service, Jackson detailed the crimes he’d been charged with alongside Manafort. It included the longtime business partners’ use and access to $75 million that flowed through unreported offshore bank accounts, as well as extensive tax fraud and years of unregistered lobbying in the U.S. for Ukrainian politicians. As Jackson recounted the long list of crimes, she paused to take a swipe at rhetoric the White House has used when tangling with Trump’s critics. “Those are facts,” Jackson “Those are not alleged facts. Those are not alternative facts.” The judge also dismissed claims that such behavior is typical on the Washington political scene. “Politics don’t corrupt people. People corrupt politics,” Jackson said. As she did at Manafort’s sentencing, Jackson also bluntly rejected claims that the pair’s unregistered lobbying for Ukrainian interests amounted to a victimless crime.  “What Gates and Manafort did was lying to the members of Congress and the American public,” the judge said. “When people don’t have the facts, democracy doesn’t work.” Jackson praised Gates for not making arguments aimed at minimizing his culpability or contending that he was somehow duped by Manafort. Gates is “not sitting here telling me Manafort forced him or coerced him across the line,” the judge said, although she said the lobbying protégé was “obviously taken with Mr. Manafort.” However, even while praising Gates’ for his decision to accept responsibility for his actions, Jackson said she fretted over the public perception and potential lack of deterrence to others if she gave him a complete pass or at least didn’t align his sentence in relation to other similar cases. “This is what I’ve been struggling with in anticipation of this sentencing for a long time,” she said. “I have to ask myself, is more needed?”  Speaking from the courtroom lectern before hearing his sentence, Gates delivered a very brief apology. “Your honor, I wish to express to this court that I accept complete responsibility for my actions that have led me here,” he said, seeming to choke up a bit as he spoke. “I greatly regret the mistakes that I’ve made and I’ve worked hard to honor my commitment to make amends. My family and I appreciate your consideration for leniency. And I hope and pray that you will grant that to me.” In addition to his cooperation with federal investigators, Gates responded to three congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony and plans to testify at any additional trials if prosecutors make the request.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston repeatedly stressed to Jackson that Gates had delivered “extraordinary” assistance to the government during the high-profile Mueller investigation. His guilty plea also came despite pressure from Manafort to maintain his innocence, as well as an offer relayed by Manafort of financial assistance through a legal defense fund. Gaston called it a “turning point” for prosecutors when Gates agreed to assist the government. “He chose to cooperate and wholeheartedly held up his end of the bargain,” she said. Perhaps more important than Gates’ testimony at any trial was his behind-the-scenes role walking prosecutors through Manafort’s complex financial arrangements, which included tens millions of dollars parked in dozens of offshore accounts with exotic names like Leviathan Advisors and Lucicle Consultants. Gaston called Gates’ testimony at Manafort’s Virginia trial “necessary” for the government to win its case against the high-flying lobbyist. The full scope of Gates’ cooperation remains unclear, since the judge received some details about that under seal.  However, the judge seemed to hint at that when she said he may still testify in future and trials. She also signaled that Gates has been working with prosecutors from coast to coast. “It’s not as if it’s just been a quick foray or dipping your toe into repentance. ... He’s been all over the country, in multiple investigations,” she said, without elaborating. Jackson’s sentencing on Tuesday closes out one of the last remaining unfinished chapters of Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Only former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and Stone still await sentencing. U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan is set to give Flynn his punishment for lying to investigators on Jan. 28. Jackson is set to sentence Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress and intimidating a witness, on Feb. 6. Gates was a focus in one of Mueller's first official public moves. The former Trump deputy campaign chairman was indicted together with Manafort in October 2017 on charges including money laundering and making false statements. Initially, Gates stuck by Manafort, pleading not guilty. The two men even discussed the possibility of a Trump pardon, according to the Mueller report. Ultimately, though, Gates turned on Manafort and Trump in February 2018, providing cooperation with federal prosecutors that resulted in the dismissal of some charges against Gates, including the tax and bank fraud crimes. Gates ended up helping the government during several closely scrutinized moments.  In August 2018, Gates incriminated Manafort from the witness stand in several crimes, including multimillion-dollar tax evasion, bank fraud and hiding offshore accounts. A jury later convicted Manafort, who is now serving a 7 1/2-year prison sentence.  Gates also appeared last month in the trial against Stone, who a jury convicted of lying to Congress about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks in the 2016 presidential race.  Federal prosecutors had Gates explain that the WikiLeaks plotting inside the Trump campaign occured far earlier than had previously been understood, and that the president was also involved in those conversations, despite his previous denials. Some of the testimony came at significant cost to Gates’ reputation — a fact Jackson alluded to Tuesday. In addition to admitting to a string of financial crimes while testifying at Manafort’s trial in Virginia last year, Gates also admitted to extramarital affairs that he had while working with Manafort. The federal judge at that trial had deemed Gates’ relationship off-limits, but when a defense attorney asked Gates about how he was funding his “secret life,” the longtime Manafort aide essentially blurted out that he’d had affairs and it was wrong. “There was a period of time, almost 10 years ago, when I had a relationship, yes,” Gates conceded.  Not every outing Gates made on the witness stand led inexorably to success for the government.  In August, prosecutors used Gates’ testimony to support a false-statement charge against former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig about his lobbying work related to Ukraine. But the testimony seemed to be of meager benefit to the government’s case, especially after Craig introduced a string of character witnesses saying they considered the defendant unfailingly trustworthy. After a three-week trial, the jury took less than five hours to acquit Craig. Prosecutors said Craig’s acquittal should not bear on Gates’ sentence. “Gates’ assistance should be evaluated independent of the jury’s decision — he should be given no more or less credit for his cooperation in that matter than had Craig been found guilty,” they wrote. Still, Gates’ two turns on the witness stand in front of Jackson redounded to his benefit as he seemed to go out of his way to appear earnest and contrite while sitting in the witness box just feet from the same judge who would sentence him. And, at times during those cases, Jackson stepped in to protect Gates when she felt defense attorneys had gone too far in tangling with the government cooperator. Gates’ decision to cooperate also had major benefits for his quality of life as the Mueller investigation unfolded. Gates was able to coach a little league baseball team for one of his four children. Jackson also approved numerous out-of-town family trips as Gates’ sentencing was repeatedly postponed. Letters submitted to the judge for Gates’ sentencing revealed that he’d also been able to spend time with his family at a particularly challenging time: his wife, Sarah, was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year and has been receiving treatment. The sentence of 45 days to be served as “intermittent confinement” appeared to take account of his wife’s medical condition and his family obligations. Gates had been looking at a maximum total sentence of 10 years in prison for the two charges he pleaded guilty to: conspiracy against the U.S. and making false statements to the FBI. Non-binding sentencing guidelines in Gates’ case called for a prison term of about four or five years, court officials calculated. But Jackson said that range was somewhat inflated because it was based on the total amount of tax losses to the U.S. government—a sum that primarily benefited Manafort. The sentencing proceeding drew the largest number of Mueller team veterans spotted at the D.C. federal courthouse since Manafort’s sentencing in March. About 20 current and former prosecutors, FBI and IRS agents and support personnel who worked on or closely with the special counsel’s office sat in two rows in the courtroom gallery. However, the area for spectators was only about half full. And in a sign of how the once mighty Mueller apparatus has dramatically scaled down, Gaston sat alone at the once-crowded prosecution table, flanked only by a couple of legal manuals and a three-ring binder.  Still, the old players made their presence known. In a moment that seemed to highlight the importance of Gates’ assistance, former Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann shook hands with Gates and his lawyer Tom Green before the start of Tuesday’s sentencing. Later, during a break in the proceedings, another former special counsel prosecutor, Greg Andres, flashed Gates and Green a thumbs-up. Before closing the morning hearing, Jackson offered Gates one final send off.  “Mr. Gates,” she said, “I’m 100 percent certain that this criminal justice system is not going to see you again.”\n",

But he didn’t, and that has left GOP donors stuck.  \"We all thought it was going to sort out after New Hampshire but there wasn't as much sorting out as we thought,\" said Fred Malek, the finance chair of the Republican Governors Association, who has strong ties to the establishment donor community.  The majority of GOP donors still on the sidelines “will probably await the results of South Carolina\" before making large investments, Malek added. Kasich’s team is trying to capitalize on his second-place finish in the Granite State, but his performance in a state where he spent the vast majority of his time and resources was not convincing enough to shift major donors out of either Rubio’s or Bush’s camps.  Given Kasich’s lack of organization in the Palmetto State and limited appeal to the important constituencies of veterans and evangelical Christians, many donors are skeptical that the Ohio governor can do well enough there to clear Bush and Rubio out of the way.  Summing up the attitude toward Kasich among many GOP donors is Minnesota broadcasting magnate, Stanley Hubbard, who now views the Ohio governor as interesting and viable but still far from a sure bet.  “My wife and I are going to give money to Kasich…I told my secretary today that we will max out [at $2,700] to him if the governor [Christie] and Fiorina drop out, which they did,” Hubbard said.  Indeed, Christie’s departure from the race leaves other candidates scurrying for his donors, but it is unclear how many will jump before South Carolina. The Kasich campaign told journalists on a conference call Thursday that it had secured the backing of Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who was one of Christie's major backers having given $250,000 to the New Jersey governor's super-PAC. But while he is a strong fundraiser, Langone does not personally write the size of checks that would be decisive in turning Kasich's fortunes. The billionaire Hubbard, who has also donated to Bush and Rubio, is hedging his bets rather than investing heavily behind one candidate, as he initially did by giving $50,000 to former candidate Scott Walker's super-PAC.  He still hopes Bush can turn things around and he said that he had a phone conversation with the Florida governor recently in which he offered some tough advice.  “I told [Bush] you gotta change your persona, put your tie on straighter, and get different glasses,” Hubbard said. “He goes on TV and his tie’s crooked… He’s gotta…not look bewildered… I said you’re getting a lot of bad advice.\" Hubbard said Bush replied that he was \"getting a lot of advice from a lot of people.”   Bush’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Several Bush fundraisers interviewed by The Hill, including Texas businessman Jay Zeidman and New York financier Anthony Scaramucci, said they were optimistic about their candidate’s chances to consolidate support since New Hampshire exposed Rubio’s vulnerabilities. But in off the record conversations, other Bush donors feel beholden and irritated.  “A lot of donors who have given to Bush… I know this is going to sound crazy, but they almost would have preferred he had gone and died quietly in New Hampshire,” said a conservative leader with strong ties among GOP mega-donors.  “Instead [Bush is] sticking around which means there’s more pressure to give money. I have not talked to a single Bush donor who was giddy about Tuesday night.”  Bush’s national finance chairman Woody Johnson, who owns the New York Jets, is asking each member of his high-powered finance committee to bring in one $2,700 campaign check per week for the next five weeks, said a source who received the instruction.  This “micro” approach, as one top fundraiser described it, indicates how difficult it has become for establishment candidates to raise hard dollars when all the enthusiasm in the Republican base is with the insurgents, Trump and Cruz.  Other establishment fundraisers and donors interviewed by The Hill say New Hampshire's results appear almost tailor-made to thwart them. “The feeling after New Hampshire is that it couldn’t have gone better for Donald Trump and it’s not just the margin that he won by, it’s the finishing order,” said the conservative leader, who added that many donors he talks to still view Kasich as unelectable but believe the Ohio governor had simply complicated the nominating process by coming second.  “Rubio was becoming a donor favorite for sure and his stumbles in the debate set him back,” the conservative leader added. “The Rubio team didn’t understand the gravity of the punch he had taken and the need to correct course. That worries a lot of people.\"  “[Donors] are not abandoning [Rubio] but they need to see him steady things this week, and the Saturday night debate [in South Carolina] becomes of primary importance for him, more than anyone else.”  The man who has given more money to Rubio’s super-PAC than anyone else, the billionaire Florida auto dealer Norman Braman, told The Hill in a telephone interview that he still has faith in the junior senator and may even increase his investment in Rubio – which currently stands at $6 million – as the primary contest progresses.  Asked how he felt after Rubio’s fifth place finish in New Hampshire, Braman replied, “Disappointed, obviously…But you know this has always been a long business.”   Another Rubio mega-donor, – New York hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer – had been making headway at convincing donors to join the Rubio camp, before the disappointing debate and New Hampshire primary.  Singer, who has given $2.5 million to Rubio’s super-PAC so far, held a private session at the Koch brothers’ donor retreat in Palm Springs earlier this month in a bid to sell Rubio’s virtues to other wealthy conservatives.  At that session, the billionaire mounted an argument that Rubio was the most electable Republican candidate and had a higher support ceiling than the evangelical-focused Cruz, said a source who attended the meeting.  But Singer’s argument, - which was well-received at the Koch retreat, carries far less weight after New Hampshire, said a number of donors interviewed. Singer's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  A member of former candidate Scott Walker’s presidential finance committee, who had been weighing his options before Tuesday night, summed up the mood of many donors who are biding their time.  “I’m not a dumb guy. I see the way the political winds blow,” he said. “I am not going to attach myself to somebody who goes down.”  This fundraiser, like many others, now finds himself doubting whether there is a center-right candidate strong enough to defeat Trump and Cruz. He is now surveying a war-zone of weakened candidates fighting for the party’s center, which is exactly what Cruz predicted in a private conversation with donors last year.  The GOP donor establishment knows it is running out of time.  “If the establishment doesn't get down to one candidate,” said Scaramucci, summing up the anxieties of many of his donor peers, “the divide and conquer strategy won't work against Trump.” View the discussion thread.

            "\t For months, we’ve watched Congress try to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the most significant expansion of health-care coverage in the U.S. since the 1965 passage of Medicare and Medicaid. While Congress has thus far failed to pass a bill undoing the ACA, there remain efforts in Washington to weaken the law and to make it harder for citizens who need coverage under the ACA to access it.  The fate of “repeal and replace” ultimately rested with a few Republican senators concerned about how their neediest constituents would fare under the proposals put forth by their GOP colleagues. They had reason to worry, because a common feature of those proposals was the gutting of federal spending on Medicaid, which now covers 40 percent of the country’s low-income adults and 76 percent of children in poverty. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that spending reductions in the more draconian proposals would have forced about 15 million poor Americans off the Medicaid rolls by 2026. However, the number of vulnerable people who would have been effectively shut out of health care is almost certainly much higher than CBO projections. With Medicaid cuts that drastic, states would have few palatable options to rein in costs. States could change eligibility requirements to exclude more people, they could hollow out the benefits going to Medicaid recipients, or they could further depress reimbursement payments going to physicians and other health-care providers, an action that in some communities would be tantamount to denying patients care.   Medicaid is already a notoriously poor payer. In Maryland, Medicaid pays family practice physicians about one-third less per patient visit than commercial insurers do. Often the payment isn’t even enough to cover the cost of the visit. If reimbursement rates were forced down further, some providers — especially those running modest practices, where viability is won or lost on small margins — would be faced with limiting the number of Medicaid patients they see or refusing them altogether. Nationwide, 41 percent of primary care physicians choose one of these two options.  I’m a pediatric gastroenterologist by training, and I lead a health sciences and human services university. One day a week, I see young patients in a clinic housed at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, where one child in three lives below the poverty line. About three-quarters of the patients I see are covered by Medicaid or by the Children’s Health Insurance Program. With such a large share of the clinic’s patients on medical assistance, the practice’s viability rests largely on our five satellite clinics across Maryland, most of whose patients are covered by private insurance. This is the balance that providers across the country have to strike every day, using payments from private insurers and from Medicare to cover the cost of treating poor Americans.  Of course, U.S. physicians aren’t obligated to see patients who can’t pay for their treatment. U.S. hospitals, on the other hand, are so obligated — and that treatment is expensive. The care delivered in a doctor’s office is often the same care the emergency department (ED) delivers at a cost that’s three to four times higher. EDs, fully staffed and equipped 24/7 for any conceivable emergency, have extremely high fixed costs. It’s not the place to access services for conditions that could be treated — or prevented — by a primary care provider, and taxpayers shouldn’t tolerate ED care as the first and last resort for the poor. In fact, Medicaid works, and it should work for everyone who needs it. A three-state study suggests that Medicaid coverage increases the amount of care patients seek across multiple settings — the expensive emergency department, yes, but also the physician’s office. Compared to uninsured individuals, people covered by Medicaid are more likely to report that they have a usual (non-emergency) source of primary care, that they’ve increased their use of preventive health visits, that they take their medications as prescribed, and that they’ve experienced an improvement in their health.  As a nation, we must work to expand — not shrink — access for those who need high-quality health care the most: the poor, the elderly, the disabled, people burdened with chronic disease. These patients deserve life-saving, life-enriching care, and they deserve providers who can afford to deliver it.  There are real and significant costs associated with caring for the nation’s poor, but the cost of doing nothing for the most vulnerable among us is far greater. For that, we pay with our very humanity. Jay A. Perman, MD, is president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. View the discussion thread.

            "\t The Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature health reform, had one big goal: to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to those who had trouble getting coverage. In essence, that meant finding ways to get America’s poor — the millions who couldn’t pay for private health insurance or were ineligible for Medicaid — health coverage. The new GOP health reform plan, the American Health Care Act, is filled with provisions — some subtle, some not — that’ll undo that work. It has long been a truism of American health care that a small group of patients cost the most money. And it is this minority, with their hefty medical bills, that are the most challenging group for any insurer to cover. The Affordable Care Act’s answer to this problem was the individual mandate: Require everybody to buy insurance through the individual mandate, and put the young, old, sick, and healthy into the same pool, evening out the risk and offsetting some of the costs of covering that minority for insurers. Under Obamacare, if you didn’t buy health insurance, you faced a fine, which scaled up based on income. The Republican plan does away with the individual mandate, and replaces it with a continuous coverage penalty: You can choose to be uninsured if you want, but when you try to buy insurance again, you face a 30 percent higher premium for a year. A new analysis by the health research firm Avalere finds this new method will be more punishing for the poor than the individual mandate was, and will actually give the wealthy a break. Just check out this chart from its report. It outlines the case of a 27-year-old seeking new health insurance on the individual market, and compares the fines he’d face under the current law (Obamacare) and under the AHCA: The red text indicates a worse deal under the Republican plan, and the green a better deal. You’ll notice that people in the higher income brackets are generally getting better deals than the lowest-income earners. That means someone who brings home $59,400 a year (500 percent of the federal poverty level) and hasn’t had insurance for a year would effectively pay a smaller penalty under the AHCA than under Obamacare, Vox’s German Lopez writes, and someone who's making $11,880 a year (100 percent of the federal poverty level) would pay more. Here’s Lopez again: In general, the AHCA penalty is just harder for the poor. Since it doesn’t scale with income, everyone, from Bill Gates to someone making nothing a year, will have to pay the same amount: a flat 30 percent extra on a premium. But that penalty ... is a much bigger share of a person’s income if he or she makes $10,000 a year instead of $100,000, $1 million, or $1 billion. In order to help more people purchase insurance, Obamacare gave people income-based tax credits. Poorer people got more help buying their coverage than richer people. These credits were important for those who didn’t get health insurance through their work, didn’t qualify for Medicaid, and needed a little help to buy their insurance on the individual marketplace. The new Republican plan gets rid of income-based subsidies and replaces them with a new system of tax credits based on age. In a sentence: The new system will be less generous than the Obamacare variation for the poor and elderly, and more helpful for the upper middle-class. Just check out this chart, via Cynthia Cox at the Kaiser Family Foundation: The group estimates that a 40-year-old making $20,000 (or 160 percent of the poverty line) would get $4,143 in subsidies under the ACA but only $3,000 under the GOP plan. A higher-earning 40-year-old, making $75,000 annually, would get no tax subsidy under the ACA but $3,000 under the Republican plan. Older folks would also fare more poorly under the AHCA. A 60-year-old earning $20,000 a year (again, 160 percent of the poverty line) would get $9,874 under Obamacare and $4,000 — or less than half that — under the new Republican plan. That’s why this Kaiser Family Foundation analysis noted, “People who are lower income, older, or live in high premium areas would be particularly disadvantaged under the American Health Care Act.” Vox's daily email explaining the biggest news in health care. After 2020, Republicans also want to end Medicaid expansion, which means the federal government would no longer help states pay for extra enrollees who weren’t eligible for Medicaid before the ACA. To understand what that means, let’s step back a bit. Prior to the passage of the law, in most states, only children and parents, pregnant women, or the disabled were eligible for Medicaid. So all other poor Americans — the working poor who didn’t have kids or who weren’t disabled — often couldn’t afford private health insurance but also weren’t eligible for Medicaid. Obamacare came along in 2010 and changed that: Suddenly anyone whose family income fell below 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $15,000 for an individual) was eligible for government health insurance. The federal government also offered states funding to pay for all the new enrollees in the program. A majority of the states (32, including Washington, DC) took the money, expanding Medicaid. And it’s no surprise. The feds offered a sweet deal. The states and the federal government share the cost of Medicaid, but the feds paid a lot more for Medicaid expansion enrollees, matching 100 percent of the states’ costs for the first three years, with a plan to phase down to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond. (Compare that with traditional Medicaid enrollees, whose costs are only partly matched by the federal government based on a formula tied to the state’s wealth. Richer places such as New York get a 50 percent match for Medicaid, while the feds pay poorer states like Mississippi up to 73 cents for every Medicaid dollar they spend.) The ACA’s Medicaid push was a huge success. Of the 20 million-plus who got health insurance through Obamacare, at least half of them got it as a result of Medicaid expansion. Now these folks are in jeopardy. Again, in 2020, the federal government will end Medicaid expansion. At the individual level, that means ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees would be covered until December 31, 2019 — assuming states don’t drop expansion before then in anticipation of the coming cuts. Then in 2020, when Medicaid expansion ends, their health insurance status wouldn’t be secure anymore. The government would only continue to match spending on the ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees who maintained continuous Medicaid coverage by staying below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. In practice, the continuous coverage requirement would mean a lot of people dropping from the program or facing a huge disincentive to earn more, said Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard health care researcher. “It’s a stealth attack on Medicaid expansion,” he said. \"The reality is people move in and out of Medicaid a lot as they go between jobs, or their seasonal income goes up and down.” It’s not just adults living in poverty who will get hurt by this plan. It’s kids too. As Vox’s Dylan Matthews reports, the new plan would change how Medicaid and CHIP, (the Children’s Health Insurance Program) work together for children. Prior to the enactment of the ACA, there were a bunch of different income levels qualifying children of different ages for Medicaid. This meant a lot of confusion for families, who might have some kids in a household on Medicaid, and others on CHIP. The ACA expanded the eligibility rule by setting a uniform 133 percent of poverty Medicaid threshold for kids. The result was that a lot of kids moved from CHIP — which can charge premiums — to Medicaid, and families finally had their kids on one health insurance plan. The AHCA would allow states to reverse that change, and the result will likely be moving kids back to the less generous CHIP program. “This is particularly concerning,” Matthews explained, “because CHIP funding is still slated to expire in September of this year, unless Congress acts.” There are even more immediate risks to Medicaid expansion in some states. Eight of the 32 states (including DC) that expanded Medicaid under the ACA included language in their laws that said they’d only continue with the program as long as the federal government paid for most of it. These “trigger states” were Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington. And in these places, Medicaid enrollees would be in particular jeopardy if the AHCA passes. According to analysts at Georgetown University, if the AHCA were to pass, the trigger states could drop 3.3 million people from Medicaid in 2020 or revoke some of their benefits, depending on the language in the state’s legislation. (This is unlike the other states that expanded Medicaid, which might keep on ACA Medicaid enrollees so long as they maintained continuous coverage.) Right now the federal government matches all the dollars states spend on Medicaid, based on the needs of people on the program. But Republicans are proposing a new funding approach, to kick in in 2020, whereby the feds will only match Medicaid spending to a certain fixed amount. If states exceed that cap to cover the needs of enrollees, they’re on the hook for 100 percent of their Medicaid costs. Researchers project the change will amount to a $280 billion cost shift to states over 10 years. Because Medicaid spending can fluctuate a lot year to year — depending on the cost of drugs, for example, or any health crises that arise — a cap system like this could be really punishing to state economies. And this will most certainly put governors in the position of having to pare down Medicaid services, limit coverage, or drop people from the program altogether. Medicaid researcher Joan Alker called this a politically “ingenious part of the Republican plan” because it’ll shift the burden to the governors to decide what to do to balance their books, and they’ll get blamed for the coverage losses that ensure. “They are going to have to raise taxes, cut services, or cut people off,” she added. There’s another stealth attack on Medicaid enrollees in the new GOP plan: It will also discontinue a program that got the medical bills of people who signed up for Medicaid covered retroactively for 90 days. Under the ACA, people’s coverage extended back three months from before they enrolled in Medicaid. This was designed to protect people living in poverty who may end up in the hospital or sick with a lot of medical bills and only then learn that they were eligible for the program. The GOP plan includes details that’ll undo this rule: People would only be eligible to get claims covered from within the same month in which they made their Medicaid application. This means that if they happen to apply for Medicaid at the beginning of the month, after racking up hospital charges for expensive treatments the month or months prior, they’ll be on the hook for all those bills. It’s another subtle change that’ll clearly sting people.\n",

            "\t NEW YORK (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is prepared to resume its money-printing program if needed to boost inflation in the euro zone but so far it has not discussed such an option, its vice-president Luis de Guindos said on Thursday. With growth and inflation in the euro zone slowing, investors have started to speculate on what the ECB could still do, having already bought 2.6 trillion euros ($2.90 trillion) worth of bonds and pushed its key interest rate below zero. De Guindos stuck to the ECB’s official expectations for a growth rebound in the second half of the year, which some of his own colleagues have started to doubt. But he maintained the ECB had many stimulus tools, including more asset purchases - known in market parlance as “quantitative easing” (QE). “We closed our QE program at the end of last year but... it’s something that we can use again if needed,” de Guindos told an event moderated by Reuters Breakingviews in New York. He cautioned however that ECB policymakers never discussed resuming bond purchases or buying stocks, an option that has been the subject of recurring market speculation. De Guindos added he expected euro zone growth to come in at 1.1-1.2 percent this year, in line with ECB forecasts published last month. But sources have told Reuters several ECB policymakers think the bank’s economic projections are too optimistic as growth weakness in China and trade tensions linger. “Our projections is that we are going to have a rebound in the second half of the year,” de Guindos said.

            "\t U.S. stocks closed broadly higher on Wednesday after the midterm election results came in about as expected, lifting a cloud of uncertainty that was weighing on the market. The major averages hit their session highs after President Donald Trump indicated he is willing to work with Democrats on policy initiatives that would help the economy keep growing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 545 points, led by gains in UnitedHealth and Apple. The gained 2.1 percent as the health care, tech and consumer discretionary sectors each rallied more than 2.8 percent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 percent. Wednesday's post-midterms rally was larger than the average gain that follows the contests. Goldman Sachs noted the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.7 percent from the day before the elections to the day after midterms. Wednesday marked the biggest post-midterms gain for both the Dow and S&P 500 since the day after the 1982 contests, when the indexes surged 4.3 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. \"Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, \" Trump said in a news conference. \"The Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for healthcare, a plan for whatever they're looking at and we'll negotiate.\" Democrats won control of the House of Representatives while Republicans retained their hold on the Senate, as the midterm's outcome split Congress. \"We believe (out of consensus) that a split Congress is the best outcome for US and global equity markets,\" said Marko Kolanovic, a widely followed quantitative analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a note. \"As the President cannot count on Congress or the Fed for more easing, he will need to do what is in his power to keep the economy rolling – drop the damaging trade war and turn it into a winning deal.\" Investors expect Trump's business-friendly policies to continue, while some expressed optimism about Congress providing a larger check on Trump's more disruptive market actions. Historically, equity markets see strong returns when Congress is divided. Stocks rallied across multiple sectors, as shares of Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs, Amazon and Alphabet all rose. Caterpillar is seen getting a boost from continued economic growth. There's also some optimism the president will work with Democrats on an infrastructure plan. Vulcan Materials and United Rentals, jumped 4.5 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Tech shares rose, as a divided Congress could also keep Trump from seriously going after giants like Amazon for being too big and influential on the economy. \"The pollsters were correct. The markets went into this, given [Tuesday's] close, expecting this outcome,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"Now the market is trying to figure out which sectors will do better.\" But trade remains one area where Trump still has most control as tariffs are on foreign goods are implemented through the executive branch. \"A further ratcheting up of measures against China in January is still a risk,\" strategists at MRB Partners said in a note. \"Such an outcome would also add to upward pressure on U.S. inflation, while adding deflationary pressure to global goods prices.\" Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is kicking off a two-day meeting on Wednesday. Worries around the pace of interest rate hikes last month saw global markets hit with sharp bouts of volatility. Markets have been pricing in a higher probability of the Fed raising rates again in December, with further tightening seen through 2019. \"I think they'll just say the data is good and they're still on the path toward normalization,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \"They have the luxury of being data dependent because inflation and wage growth show no signs of the economy overheating.\" Equities in the U.S. closed higher on Tuesday as the elections began earlier in the day. Defense stocks are also among the expected winners from a divided Congress as it is one of the areas Democrats and Trump may find common ground. Democrats agreed to a Defense Department budget increase for fiscal year 2019. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, said financials could lose out as the Democrats take control of the House. \"In terms of the financials, they might need a bit more deregulation and that is harder to promote under a split Congress,\" he said. Overall, stocks typically do well when Congress is split and the White House is under Republican control. In those instances, the S&P 500 averages an annual return of 12 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"The best case scenario from here, in our view, might be gridlock: do nothing, and undo nothing,\" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts and economists in a report leading up to the election. These results could also lead to more investigations into Trump and therefore more stock market volatility. But regardless of how the elections shake out, this is the best buying opportunity for investors before year-end, said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. \"This is your entry point,\" he said, adding that positive seasonal factors, including strong holiday sales, should boost markets higher before the end of 2018. \"You might get some volatility in the next couple of days as the market absorbs the result, but you buy those dips. ... Everything is telling you this is the time to buy\" following the correction in October. —CNBC's Ryan Browne, Tom Franck and Patti Domm contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t President Donald Trump said Tuesday that \"I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia\" — but in fact he has boasted in the past that \"I make a lot of money with them.\" Trump's tweet denying a financial stake in Saudi Arabia comes amid a growing furor over suspicions that the country's rulers ordered the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the consulate. The Saudi government is discussing a plan to admit that The Washington Post contributor was killed after entering that building, according to NBC News, which cited multiple sources. But that admission, NBC News said, could include a claim that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did not order the killing or know if it. Trump's attempt to distance himself from profiting from Saudi Arabia is undercut by a long record showing deals his companies made with that country's government and citizens. \"Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million,\" Trump said during a presidential campaign rally in Alabama in August 2015. \"Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\" At another rally that year, Trump said of the Saudis, \"I make a lot of money from them.\" \"They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump. They pay me millions and hundred of millions.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC on Trump's tweet and his past comments about earnings from Saudis. When he first announced his bid for the White House in Trump Tower in New York in 2015, Trump said, \"I love the Saudis.\" \"Many are in this building.\" In another Trump-owned building in the Big Apple, Trump World Tower, the Saudi government had bought an entire floor for $4.5 million in 2001. The New York Daily News reported in 2016 that common charges for that floor paid by the Saudis to Trump's company would have been at least $5.7 million if those charges remained the same as they were when the floor was bought. Thirteen years before that purchase, Trump himself had paid a reported $29 million for a 281-foot yacht, the Nabila, which had been originally built for Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi arms dealer, but was owned by the Sultan of Brunei at the time of Trump's purchase. Khashoggi, now dead, was a cousin to Jamal Khashoggi. In 1991, while going through what was one of a series of financial squeezes in his career as a real estate mogul and casino operator, Trump sold the big boat, since renamed \"Trump Princess,\" to Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. And he sold it at a loss: $20 million. More recently, as president, Saudi money has again benefited Trump. The Washington Post reported earlier this year that revenue at the Trump hotel on the West Side of Manhattan had increased after two straight years of revenue drops. The general manager of that hotel, which Trump's company manages, but does not own, informed investors that revenue in the first quarter of 2018 jumped due in part to \"a last-minute visit to New York by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\" according to the Post. While the prince himself did not stay at the hotel, \"due to our close industry relationships, we were able to accommodate many of the accompanying travelers,\" the manager reportedly wrote. Earlier this month, the Post reported that bookings at the Trump hotel in Chicago dropped 8 percent from 2015 to 2016, and that bookings this year are 3.5 percent lower than what they were in 2016. But the decrease was offset, to a certain degree, by business from the Saudis, the paper added. Citing a document issued to investors in the hotel, the Post said that \"Saudi-based customers had booked 218 nights at Trump Chicago this year — a 169 percent increase from the same period in 2016.\"\n",

            "\t  (CNN)US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has pulled out of a planned visit to Beijing in October, a US official tells CNN, the latest sign of deteriorating ties between the United States and China. Mattis had originally planned to visit the Chinese capital to meet with senior Chinese officials to discuss security issues. The last-minute cancellation has not been publicly confirmed by the Pentagon. The decision to pull out of the trip comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing across multiple fronts, from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods to new sanctions announced against the Chinese military. At a press conference on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said his often-mentioned friendship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have come to an end. \"He may not be a friend of mine anymore. But I think he probably respects me,\" Trump said. The Trump administrations imposed 10% of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods on September 24, in addition to the trade measures already in place. The Chinese government responded in kind, with between 5% to 10% tariffs on $60 billion of US goods. Following the new round of tariffs, Beijing called off planned trade talks with Washington, leaving no end in sight for the ongoing trade war. \"How could you negotiate with someone when he puts a knife on your neck?\" China's deputy trade negotiator Wang Shouwen said at a press conference Tuesday, saying resuming talks would be difficult. Rising military tensions In a sign of growing tensions, the Chinese government canceled a port visit to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp, a US Navy amphibious assault ship, last week. It followed closely the decision by the US government to sanction Chinese military figures over their purchases of Russian combat aircraft and missile systems. The US sanctions were imposed on the Chinese military's Equipment Development Department and its director, provoking a stern response from the Chinese government. Wu Qian, Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman, said they had expressed their \"strong indignation and firm opposition\" to the Pentagon. In a move unlikely to improve relations, the US Navy released a series of photos Friday of the USS Wasp taking part in a live-fire exercise in the South China Sea, firing on inflatable targets with mounted machine guns and sniper rifles. The South China Sea is one of the most disputed regions in the world, and the Chinese government claims a huge swathe of territory which it has reinforced with militarized artificial islands.  On Sunday, the US Navy sailed a warship close to disputed islands in the South China Sea. Two US officials told CNN that the guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls \"freedom of navigation operations,\" which are meant to enforce the right of free passage in international waters. \"Increasing the lethality of the Navy-Marine Corps Team is the priority for us. Sailors and Marines are doing amazing work and we are becoming more lethal every single day,\" Rear Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of Amphibious Force 7th Fleet, said in a US Navy statement. Accusations of election influence The diplomatic rift between Washington and Beijing has also spilled over from military and trade issues into the political arena in the past week, after US President Trump accused China of meddling in the upcoming US elections. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council Wednesday, Trump said the Chinese government was attempting to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections to tilt them against the Republicans. \"They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,\" Trump said. \"We are winning on trade. We are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.\" To back up his claims, Trump later tweeted a photo of a Chinese state media paid supplement which had been placed in the Iowa-based Des Moines Register. \"China is actually placing propaganda ads in (the Register) and other papers, made to look like news!\" he said. Chinese state media has a long history of placing paid articles and pullouts in foreign media, full of positive articles about China. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi furiously denied Trump's claims, shortly after he made them, saying Beijing had a \"principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs.\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang went one step further on Thursday, suggesting Washington was the country \"most accustomed\" to interfering in other countries' affairs. \n",

Officials for the nation’s top business lobbying group, who said they had been engaged with those familiar with the talks, told reporters in a conference call that they also expected negotiations to continue past the March 1 deadline. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are meeting in Washington this week, seeking to hammer out a deal that would avert a scheduled increase in U.S. levies after that date, to 25 percent from 10 percent, on $200 billion worth of goods. “To us, the date is not magical. What’s important is to get a comprehensive sustainable agreement,” said the Chamber’s executive vice president and head of international affairs Myron Brilliant, noting he did not expect either side to impose more tariffs or increase existing ones as long as the talks continue to be constructive. Brilliant, whose group says it represents three million companies, said so far the trade war between the world’s two largest economies has increased business costs with the impact of tariffs continuing to mount. “We want to go back to business, but not business as usual,” Brilliant said, emphasizing that it was important any deal address the core U.S. concerns around Chinese business practices as well as ensure sustainable enforcement. President Donald Trump was scheduled to meet Beijing’s Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House later on Friday. The two countries have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat tariff battle since the middle of 2018 that has cost both economies billions. The Republican president has said next week’s deadline may slip.

            "\t Washington (CNN)The US government is increasingly concerned that advances in North Korea's weapons program have dramatically decreased the warning time for a nuclear attack on America or its allies, according to US officials.  The regime's aggressive testing of medium- and long-range missiles -- as well as its nuclear testing -- makes North Korea now a \"practical\" threat and no longer a \"theoretical\" threat, in the words of one US official familiar with the latest US intelligence thinking. Significantly, North Korea no longer cares if the world sees its test failures, according to the latest analyses, allowing Pyongyang to more openly, aggressively and repeatedly test all of the key components needed for an attack. RELATED: Kim Jong Un: We'll only use nuclear weapons if sovereignty threatened As a result, the regime has the ability to hold the US and allies \"at risk\" with nuclear weapons, the US official said. \"When you have this many tests, you are eventually going to get it right. That's what concerns me,\" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst. \"As soon as they have one test that they could classify as an extreme success, then we are talking a whole different ballgame (in) their potential to threaten other sovereign nations in their area but also potentially parts of the United States.\" At this point, the US now works on the assumption North Korea has achieved warhead miniaturization -- essential for a missile attack. RELATED: North Korea claims missile test success New satellites images from the 38 North website reveal activity at North Korea's nuclear test site, showing a canopy has been erected to block the view of US spy satellites. And in recent missile tests, North Korea has fired: mobile missiles that are difficult to track, submarine launched missiles, also difficult to track, and intercontinental missiles that can potentially reach Alaska. The bottom line, officials said, is with small warheads, road-mobile missiles and sub-launched missiles, there is no early warning. Most concerning, they said, is the recent intermediate-range launch went within 150 miles of Japan coastline -- just a few seconds of flight. \n",

            "\t THE destination was decided in June, by simple majority: Britain is leaving the European Union. The journey, however, will be complex and perilous, beset by wrong turnings, chicanes and elephant traps. With 64m Britons in the back seat, perhaps that is why Theresa May has avoided talking about the road ahead. But at the Conservative Party conference this week the new prime minister could delay no longer. In a speech that thrilled party activists, she declared that she will invoke Article 50 of the EU treaty by the end of March, triggering a two-year countdown that should see Britain leave the union in early 2019. She also hinted that she would be prepared to steer Britain towards a harder sort of Brexit, involving a wide separation of labour, product and financial markets. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Mrs May is at risk of putting her party before her country—with grave consequences. Brexit will determine Britain’s fortunes in the decades to come. If it is to be done at all, it must be done right. Mrs May faces an inevitable tension. Domestically, if she is not to be overwhelmed by the politics of Europe, as so many Tory prime ministers have been before her, she needs to convince those who voted to leave that their victory will be honoured. That is why her speech conveyed urgency and, when it came to immigration, sovereignty and the jurisdiction of the European court in Luxembourg, she took a hard line. In Europe, however, this domestic rhetoric will impede Mrs May’s task of negotiating the best possible form of Brexit. To maximise her bargaining power, Mrs May needs time. To get the best deal, she needs to be flexible on immigration. The centrepiece of the deal ought to be to secure maximum access to Europe’s single market. Brexiteers say that, once outside, Britain would eventually negotiate low or no tariffs on its trade with the EU. Yet, even if it did, tariffs are less than half the problem. Without harmonised regulations, British firms will discover that their products do not meet European requirements, and vice versa. And it is unlikely that a trade deal between Britain and the EU would cover services, including the financial sort that are among Britain’s biggest exports. A study by the Treasury before the referendum estimated that the hit to GDP within two years of Brexit would be nearly twice as large if Britain left the single market than if it remained a member. Mrs May seems to want to carve out a special deal with the EU, in which Britain limits immigration and determines product standards—on, say, food-labelling—while still operating fully in the single market. Perhaps the negotiations will show that this is possible. However, the signs are that she is overestimating the EU’s willingness to give ground. Each country has a veto over Britain’s status (see article). On almost every issue, from immigration to financial services, at least one of them will be reluctant to surrender its advantages. If that means Mrs May must give ground on immigration, remember that such “concessions” actually benefit Britain. The supply of workers and students from the EU has helped Britain grow faster than any other member state in recent years. To avoid suffocating industry, ministers have already indicated that they may let in financial-services employees, as well as seasonal agricultural workers. There are sure to be more exceptions as bottlenecks emerge. The second ingredient of a good Brexit is a sensible transition to the new regime—especially if Britain is about to walk away from the single market. The bureaucracy and cost of a sudden imposition of tariffs and non-tariff barriers would lead to a brutal dislocation. Separation from the EU will involve divvying up EU-owned assets, pensions and much else. Everything from fishing rights to aircraft-landing slots are agreed on at an EU level; these rules must be redrafted and re-regulated. Amid the world’s most complex divorce, Britain’s diplomats also have another vital task. Through its membership of the EU, Britain is a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and party to free-trade deals with 53 other countries. When it leaves, it will lose all that. So Britain must urgently prepare to rejoin the WTO as an individual country—which, again, requires the consent of every other member. Mrs May seemed to acknowledge the benefits of a smooth transition this week. Her proposed “Great Repeal Bill”, which will get rid of all existing EU law from the statute book, will in fact merely translate it into British law, to be chipped away later at leisure if desired. She should likewise negotiate an interim trade deal—through temporary membership of the European Economic Area, say, of which Norway is part. This would mean paying into the EU budget and accepting free movement but, in return, Britain could take as long as it needs to line up WTO accession and trade agreements with the EU and other countries, while still under the shelter of the single market. Ardent Brexiteers worry that, ensconced in such a halfway house, Britain would stay put for ever. That is indeed a possibility, and there is no reason it should not be: with half the population having voted to Remain and many of those who voted to Leave reluctant to quit the single market, a majority might favour such a “soft” Brexit. The final ingredient of the approach Mrs May put forward was her broad agenda to open Britain to the world beyond the EU—which she calls “Global Britain”. In theory this should entail a willingness to welcome international capital and labour, which would benefit the country whatever its relations with the EU. Sadly, the reality looks less rosy. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, this week complained that some companies were employing too many foreigners and talked about “flushing out” the worst offenders. Likewise, Mrs May’s conference rhetoric was strikingly interventionist, putting the state at the heart of the economy. A flirtation with industrial policy sounds worryingly as if it is designed to keep foreigners out. A Brexit of some sort looms and Mrs May will determine its course. If Britain is not to suffer a car crash, she must ignore the back-seat drivers and fix her eyes firmly on the road ahead.\n",

            "\t PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should keep raising interest rates over the next couple of years, including about four times between now and the end of 2018, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday. “From today, four rate hikes through the end of next year is still kind of my base view,” Williams told reporters after an economics forecast luncheon. Williams rotates into a voting spot on the Fed’s policysetting panel next year. “We need to get from here to roughly 2.5 percent fed funds rate over the next couple of years.” The Fed currently targets short-term interest rates at between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, and is expected to raise them in December. Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n",
            "\t ...\n",
            "\t Along with an expected rate hike in December, some central bank watchers expect the Federal Reserve to approve another tweak to ensure that its current policy path, which has come under increasing pressure lately, proceeds smoothly. If the Fed is unable to manage the range where it keeps its benchmark interest rate, that could lead it to halt the unwinding of its balance sheet comprised of bonds it purchased to lower mortgage rates and stimulate the economy. The economic and market ramifications could be substantial, though there's no indication now that the Fed is considering halting the balance sheet reduction. The market has long been expecting the Fed to go through with a 25 basis point (0.25 percentage point) increase in its benchmark funds rate at the year's final Federal Open Market Committee Meeting. Under normal circumstances, such a move would be accompanied by a commensurate quarter-point hike in the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves from banks, or the IOER. The current level is 2.2 percent, compared with the 2 percent to 2.25 percent range for the funds rate. However, the funds rate has risen near the top boundary of its range, to 2.2 percent to equal the IOER, and that presents a problem. The Fed uses the IOER to guide the funds rate, generally as a floor for where the funds rate should be. The central bank manages its funds rate through the interest rate on reserves and its overnight repo facility, which also helps the Fed to set a floor on rates. This year, as government debt issuance has surged and rates have increased on the repo purchases in which the Fed has purchased, the funds rate has drifted to the upper end of its target range. Back in June, the Fed addressed the issue by raising the IOER just 20 basis points to try to push the funds rate more toward the center of the range. That worked for a few months, but the two rates have drifted closer together and on Oct. 23 met at 2.2 percent. The Fed has \"lost control over rates\" at the upper bounds of its target range, said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Though \"none of this is too troubling for the Fed\" so long as it is again able to manage the funds rate back down to the middle of the range, continued pressure could result in a policy change. Fed officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"With reserves abundant, it is unlikely that the effective funds rate will rise much above the IOER,\" Pearce said in a note. \"If it did, however, the Fed would presumably conclude that there was less excess liquidity than previously believed and, as a result, bring its quantitative tightening to a premature end.\" Importantly, Fed officials noted in minutes from the last FOMC meeting that the rise in the funds rate did not seem to emanate from a lack of reserves, which would be more troubling. The Fed is allowing up to $50 billion worth of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to run off its balance sheet each month in an effort to reduce the bond portfolio from its $4.5 trillion peak, with the current level at $4.2 trillion. Indications that reserves are tightening and pressuring rates higher might push the central bank to ease off the balance sheet reduction. The issue arises at a time, however, when the Fed is facing increasing scrutiny over whether it should continue hiking rates and drawing down the balance sheet, a process the market has come to call \"QT\" for quantitative tightening. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized the Fed for raising rates, and bank analyst Dick Bove said in an essay for CNBC.com that the central bank is \"imposing a new rigid financial system on the economy.\" However, the September FOMC meeting summary noted that the balance sheet program has produced a \"muted\" market reaction so far. Whether that continues, though, could depend on the relationship between the IOER and the funds rate. Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said he even has fielded questions about whether the Fed might cut the IOER rate to 2.15 percent at the Nov. 6-7 FOMC meeting to further put the clamps on the funds rate. \"Communicating a 5bp cut in a key policy rate in the midst of policy normalization presents obvious drawbacks,\" Hollenhorst said in a note. \"Consequently we think a 5bp cut in November is unlikely unless [the Fed funds rate] is printing above 2.25% (unlikely, in our view).\" In the wake of significant market volatility in October, traders have reduced their probability of a December funds rate hike to 74 percent, from 87 percent a week ago, according to CME data. The probability of a March 2019 increase is down to 48 percent from about 62 percent a week ago.\n",

            "\t The U.S. and Turkish militaries have begun training for joint patrols in the northern Syrian city of Manbij, Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisOnly Donald Trump has a policy for Afghanistan New Pentagon report blames Trump troop withdrawal for ISIS surge in Iraq and Syria Mattis returns to board of General Dynamics MORE said Monday. “The training now is under way, and we’ll just have to see how that goes,” Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Paris, according to Reuters. “We have every reason to believe the joint patrols will be coming on time, when the training syllabus is complete so that we do it right.” Manbij has been a key point of tension in the fraught U.S. relationship with NATO ally Turkey. Turkey has been demanding the withdrawal of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces from the city, which was retaken from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in 2016. Ankara considers the Kurdish forces to be terrorists connected to a Kurdish insurgency in its borders, while Washington considers them the most effective local force fighting ISIS in Syria. In June, the United States and Turkey reached an agreement on a “Manbij Roadmap” that sets the withdrawal of the Kurds from the city. As part of the roadmap, U.S. and Turkish forces have been conducting separate patrols. Joint patrols are seen as a way to mitigate potential violence between the various groups in the area. Training for the joint patrols had been delayed as equipment was brought in and the United States and Turkey worked out some remaining details. On Monday, Mattis said the U.S. military has started instructing Turkey’s military trainers and that training of the broader Turkish forces will follow soon. The training is happening in Turkey. Mattis said the Turkish military has “been very helpful, very professional on setting the rules of engagement and the training up, and we’re on the ground there now,” as reported by The Associated Press. Outside of Manbij, U.S.-Turkish relations have been frosty over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor who has lived in Istanbul for more than 20 years. The pastor, Andrew Brunson, was arrested in 2016 on espionage and terror-related charges related to the failed coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The White House has said the charges against Brunson are baseless and has demanded his release. His next court hearing is Oct. 12. The U.S. has also been warning Turkey against purchasing a Russian missile defense system. Western officials oppose the purchase because it would put the system in close proximity to NATO weaponry.

Our partners on the ground, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), are capable fighters but rely on U.S. equipment, training and air and artillery support. They also must keep one eye on the constant threat of Turkish attack, which will only become more likely with the United States gone. The decision to withdraw from Syria therefore dangerously resembles America’s hasty exit from Iraq in 2011. Much like Trump with Syria, campaign promises more than metrics of success on the ground drove President Obama’s decision to leave Iraq. Obama’s premature departure created a security vacuum, promptly filled by Shiite Iran, that deepened alienation among Iraq’s Sunnis. This encouraged violent sectarians like ISIS, whose rise Tehran then used to justify tightening its grip over Baghdad, and so on. Leaving Syria now portends a repeat. With ISIS still capable of reconstituting itself and Iran no longer checked by U.S. forces along the Euphrates, the twin scourges of Iranian expansionism and Sunni extremism will further fuel each other in a vicious and incredibly destabilizing cycle. Turkish intervention that distracts the SDF from fighting ISIS would magnify this chaos. The U.S. departure also removes the biggest remaining physical obstacle to Tehran’s consolidation of a corridor stretching unhindered through Iraq and Syria to Hezbollah, the Mediterranean, Golan Heights and Jordan. Comfortably astride this “land bridge,” Iran could more readily threaten U.S. allies by entrenching missiles and proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. As with the withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and the unenforced redline against Assad’s chemical weapons use, hastily leaving Syria also will undermine the credibility of other U.S. commitments. Having publicly staked itself to using U.S. forces as leverage for ensuring Iran’s departure from Syria, the Trump administration is undermining its own strong rhetoric against Iran. This will layer more Iranian appetite for regionwide aggression on top of increasing opportunities to do so. It will also make Tehran’s and Moscow’s support for Assad look better and better in comparison to Washington’s capriciousness toward its own partners. Despite the challenges now facing them, American policymakers can take immediate steps to address these new capability and credibility deficits. Given the readiness of certain allies like the SDF and Israel to push back against our shared adversaries – plus the depreciating value of U.S. verbal guarantees – these steps should focus on reassuring and strengthening our partners. Most immediately, this means giving them hard power assets to defend against the threats that will only grow as U.S. forces depart. The SDF is a motivated and effective combat force, but one that will need ongoing assistance to further attrite ISIS, secure liberated territory – including valuable agricultural and energy fields – and have some leverage against the predations of Assad and Erdogan. The United States must provide its Syrian allies with equipment that gives them at least a chance to keep the pressure on ISIS while preserving themselves and their hard-won gains against ISIS. Withdrawal also raises the risks for Israel of major conflict with Iran and its proxies, first and foremost Hezbollah and its lethal missile arsenal. When it comes, this conflict will impose unprecedented operational demands on Israel, making it vital for the United States to ensure its ally has sufficient capabilities to deter and when necessary defeat this threat as quickly and decisively as possible. As the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) recommended in a recent report, the United States should frontload its ten-year, $38 billion memorandum of understanding on defense assistance to Israel – without adding a penny overall. The United States also urgently must replenish and update its stockpiles of prepositioned weapons in Israel, emphasizing precision-guided munitions and missile defense interceptors (the latter of which also help shield Jordan). This could be expedited by relocating prepositioned stockpiles from other countries less threatened by the consequences of U.S withdrawal from Syria. By no means will these steps completely countervail the decision to abandon the fight against ISIS and, with it, strategically critical territory in Syria. But as Middle East tensions worsen as a direct result of U.S. withdrawal, giving our allies more tools to defend themselves will at least send a concrete signal that America still stands by its friends and values regional stability.

            "\t (Adds Graham comment, report of New Jersey Democrat switching parties) WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives made a last-minute pitch to Republicans on Sunday for why they should put partisanship aside and vote to impeach President Donald Trump. Trump is expected to become the third U.S. president to be impeached when the full Democratic-led House votes on the charges, likely this week, setting up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" warned that Trump poses \"a clear and present danger\" to democracy. Schiff and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, speaking on the same show, said lawmakers have a constitutional duty to hold Trump to account for trying to recruit Ukraine to launch a corruption investigation into his Democratic political rival Joe Biden. Their comments come as the Democratically-controlled U.S. House is poised later this week to vote along party lines on whether to approve two articles of impeachment. The Republican-controlled Senate has shown little appetite for removing Trump from office. \"The misconduct hasn't stopped,\" Schiff said, noting that Trump has still urged Ukraine, as well as China, to investigate the Biden family, and that Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is still traveling to Ukraine to conduct a \"sham\" investigation. \"The threat to our election integrity ... goes on. It's a clear and present danger, I think, to our democracy and not something that we can turn away from simply because the Republicans in the House refuse to do their duty.\" Both Democrats used their air time on Sunday to urge the Senate to call witnesses and seek documentary evidence that they said the White House has withheld. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has raised the prospect of conducting a short Senate impeachment trial without calling any witnesses. Nadler on Sunday said such a move would do a disservice to the Senate, whose members will all effectively serve as jurors who will need to weigh the evidence to decide whether Trump should be convicted and removed from office. Some of Trump's staunch Republican defenders in the Senate have already said they believe Trump did nothing wrong, though others have taken a more cautious approach, saying they want to see the evidence first. During an interview with CNN International at the Doha Forum in Qatar on Saturday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham dismissed the idea that he should be a \"fair juror\" and said he does not see the need for a formal trial in the Senate. But Republican Senator Pat Toomey on Sunday said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\", \"I think we ought to hear what the House impeachment managers have to say, give the President's attorneys an opportunity to make their defense, and then make a decision about whether and to what extent we go forward from there.\" Separately this weekend, the Washington Post reported that Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, an anti-impeachment Democrat, will soon join the Republican Party. Trump tweeted in response to the news: \"Wow, that would be big. Always heard Jeff is very smart!\" (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch, Chris Sanders and David Lawder Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n",

            "\t * Chicago corn rises for 6th consecutive session * Corn planting delays in U.S. Midwest support prices * Kansas leads wheat gains as rain threatens winter crops * Soybeans rebound after Friday slide (Adds closing prices) CHICAGO, May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures climbed for a sixth straight session on Monday and touched their highest level in nearly a year as rainy Midwest weather and waterlogged fields stoked concerns about reduced plantings and lower yields for the crop. Wheat jumped to a three-month high on delayed spring wheat planting in the northern U.S. Plains and excessive, potentially crop damaging rains and flooding in the southern Plains, including in top winter wheat state Kansas. Soybeans rose in tandem with wheat and corn, lifted by short covering following Friday's steep slide. Soybeans gained despite stalled trade talks between the United States and China, the world's top soy buyer. Grain traders were primarily focused on soggy U.S. weather that has delayed spring field work and on forecasts for continued rains. \"The rains slowed corn and soybean planting, especially across the western corn belt. Wet weather is expected to continue across the western Midwest and the Plains this week,\" Kyle Tapley, meteorologist with Radiant Solutions, said in a note to clients. \"Very little, if any, planting progress is expected in the western corn belt this week,\" he said. Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, estimated 50 percent of the U.S. corn crop was planted as of Sunday, well behind the five-year average of 80 percent for this point in the season. Soybean plantings were seen at 22 percent done, versus 47 percent on average. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is due to release its weekly planting progress report on Monday afternoon. \"If we come in below 50 percent (on corn) as of Sunday, this would be record low planting progress for any year since USDA started the data series in 1980,\" said Rich Nelson, chief strategist with Allendale Inc. Delayed corn planting may prompt some farmers to shift to seeding soybeans instead, or leave fields fallow. Farmers who plant corn particularly late or under adverse weather conditions could see below-average yields, Nelson said. Chicago Board of Trade July corn ended up 5-3/4 cents at $3.89 per bushel, after breaking through and holding chart support at its 200-day moving average. The most-active contract , which has climbed more than 10 percent over six sessions, hit its highest level for a since June 1, 2018. July soybeans rose 10 cents to $8.31-3/4 a bushel, while CBOT July wheat surged 17-1/2 cents to a three-month high of $4.78-1/4 a bushel. Commodity funds hold large short positions in all grains markets, leaving them susceptible to bouts of short covering.

            "\t U.S. grain futures were lower Friday after a government report released a day earlier showed supplies for key crops are more than ample, adding to the selling pressure going into the long Fourth of July weekend. \"A lot of people don't want to go home long in any of the markets, especially with the holiday weekend like this where make it or break it rains are coming this weekend,\" said Terry Reilly, analyst at Futures International in Chicago. \"The unpredictability in the weather will send a lot of traders to go home with a zero position.\" On the Chicago Board of Trade, the wheat contract for September delivery fell 3.6 percent, settling down 16.25 cents at $4.3025 a bushel. For the week, wheat was down about 7.5 percent. Chicago's December oats contract fell 6.75 cents, or 3.4 percent, to settle at $1.9275 a bushel; corn for December was down 4 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $3.670 a bushel; and soybeans for November slipped 16 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $11.3750 a bushel. The November soybeans contract still was up 5 percent for the full week and remains up nearly 30 percent year-to-date. \"The volume was a little choppy Friday because a lot of people were already on holiday,\" Reilly said. Meantime, two U.S. Department of Agriculture reports released Thursday, Grain Stocks and Planned Acreage, were mostly seen as negative for crop prices. \"The acreage for corn, which folks out there thought was going to be cut, was actually increased, suggesting that the supply of corn for the coming season is more than ample,\" said Michael Shlisky, who covers agriculture for Seaport Global Securities in New York. \"On the soybean side, perhaps it's more near-term inventories that exceeded expectations.\" Estimates for corn and wheat in the Planted Acreage report came in higher than industry analysts' consensus, while soybean acreage in the government report was slightly below some expectations. For corn, analysts were generally looking for a 700,000-acre haircut, but the quarterly report came in with a 500,000-acre increase. USDA's Grain Stocks report, covering domestic inventories stored as of June 1, showed estimates for both corn and soybeans were above expectations. As of June 1, old crop oats stored were 6 percent above the stocks a year ago — and the government said total stocks on hand were 21 percent above year-earlier levels. USDA said corn planted for 2016 was estimated at 94.1 million acres, up 7 percent from last year and the third highest planting acreage in the U.S. since 1944. The area harvested for grain was estimated up 7 percent from the prior year levels and the represented the third-highest area harvested for grain since 1933. Soybean planted acreage for the current year was seen at a record high 83.7 million acres, meaning it would be up 1 percent from last year. The area for harvest was also up 1 percent from 2015, and the government said that meant it would be a record high if realized. The next big ag report that analysts see moving the grain markets is USDA's World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, scheduled for release on July 12. Elsewhere, August feeder cattle futures fell 1.4 percent and the August live cattle contract declined 1.6 percent. USDA figures show cattle on feed as of June 1 were up slightly more than 2 percent from year-ago levels.\n",

            "\t WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he will look for “land mines” in a government funding bill, though he also said he does not want to close the government for the second time this winter.  Trump told reporters before a meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque that he would decide whether to sign the government funding legislation when he sees it.  “We haven’t gotten it (the legislation) yet. We’ll be getting it. We’ll be looking for land mines,” Trump said.  “I don’t want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing. I think a point was made with the last shutdown. People realized how bad the border is, how unsafe the border is, and I think a lot of good points were made,” he added.  Trump said earlier this week he was unhappy with lawmakers’ compromise deal, which gives him $1.37 billion for fencing along the southern border with Mexico, rather than the $5.7 billion he is seeking to build his promised border wall.  But a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday that the president would likely back the bipartisan legislation.  For 35 days in December and January, the federal government was hit by a partial shutdown that was the longest in U.S. history. Some members of Trump’s right-wing base have criticized him for opening the government without receiving funding for the border wall.

Members of the president's administration said they expect the government to remain open — and are skeptical that lawmakers would shut down the government over the proposed construction. Trump administration officials and GOP lawmakers warned of the consequences of a government shutdown — even as Democrats have come out strongly against passing a bill that would allot funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Sessions said the administration's goal is to put an end to illegality and \"create a lawful system of immigration where people apply to come here, they wait their turn.\" \"I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall,\" Kelly said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"So I would suspect — he'll do the right thing for sure — but I suspect he will be insistent on the funding.\" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said he thinks the government can avoid a shutdown and expressed confidence a bill that is \"satisfactory\" to the president will pass.  \"So I'm pretty confident we're going to get something that's satisfactory to the president,\" he said, when asked if President Trump will veto the government funding bill if there is no down payment on his proposed border wall included.  \"I think that as long as the president's priorities are adequately reflected ... and there's enough as far as flexibility for the border wall and border security, I think we'll be OK with that.\" “The last thing we can afford is to send a message to the world that the United States government, by the way, is only partially functioning,” Rubio told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I mean, that would just have catastrophic impact, in my view, or certainly very destabilizing, I should say, impact on global affairs. And so we should keep that in mind going into this week.” \"The president talks about how tall it is, who's going to pay for it and all the rest of that, but you have to understand this part of the country. There's a community with the border going through it,\" she said during an interview on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" \"The president, I think, talking about this wall, is expressing a sign of weakness. He's saying, 'I can't control our borders. I have to build a wall.'\" Lawmakers can avoid a government shutdown if they pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government open while negotiations continue over a broader funding deal and other hot-button issues. Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney on Friday suggested that for every $1 of funding for the ObamaCare program, Democrats should agree to $1 of funding for Trump's border wall. But so far, Democrats have rebuffed the offer. The president on Sunday criticized Democrats, saying they don't want money going to the wall even though it will \"stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.\" He also expressed confidence he would fulfill his campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the structure. \"Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early,\" he tweeted, \"Mexico will be paying in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\" View the discussion thread.

            "\t New York (CNN Business)Boeing's future rides on the success of the 737 Max. But all of those planes remain grounded, waiting for the world's aviation regulators to approve a software fix that will make them safer to fly. The 737 Max does not appear close to flying again. Aviation experts doubt global regulators will act in concert to approve the 737 Max for flight, because serious questions remain about how and why the FAA approved the 737 Max for flight and whether it rushed the certification process.  The world's aviation authorities have lost confidence in the US Federal Aviation Administration. In the past when planes were grounded, other regulators followed the FAA's lead. When the FAA approved grounded planes to fly again, regulators around the world similarly let them fly too. That's what happened when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded because of battery problems in 2013.  But this time, getting the FAA to sign off on the fix won't by itself solve Boeing's problems. That could be troubling news for Boeing (BA) as it tries to return the planes to service as soon as possible.  The 737 Max is by far Boeing's bestselling plane, with orders for 5,000 of the workhorse single aisle jet on its books. Boeing's profit fell 21% last quarter because it halted 737 Max orders during grounding, and it has to reimburse airlines that have to use alternate planes. Boeing has already spent at least $1 billion on a software fix it hopes can get the planes back in the air.  The stakes could not be higher for the company, America's largest exporter. Damaged credibility Boeing is seeking regulatory approval for its software fix a 737 Max automatic safety feature, which is the focus of the investigations into two recent fatal crashes. Questions about how the plane was certified in the first place means lifting the grounding won't be easy.  The FAA's certification process is under investigation by Congress and the Department of Transportation. \"Clearly confidence in the FAA as the gold standard in aviation safety has been shaken,\" DOT Inspector General Calvin Scovel testified at a Senate hearing last month. If global aviation regulators don't agree to end the 737 Max's grounding, that could create costly delays for Boeing. More than 80% of the 737 Max planes that are grounded are flown by airlines outside the United States. Boeing will need those aviation authorities around the globe to lift their orders grounding the jets for their customers to begin flying the planes once again. \"It will be jarring if other countries don't immediately follow. I'll be disappointed. But I guess I won't be too surprised if other countries thumb their nose at us and don't follow immediately,\" said Jeffrey Guzzetti, a former director of the FAA's accident investigation division. Authorities from nine different countries met for a week's worth of meetings in Seattle recently to discuss problems with the 737 Max. The group, dubbed the Joint Authorities Technical Review, was headed by Chris Hart, the immediate past chairman of National Transportation Safety Board, which is independent from the FAA.  Hart told CNN Business he is \"not confident at all\" that countries will unanimously and simultaneously approve the 737 Max's return to service. Instead, each country may approve the plane on its own schedule. Aviation regulators have good reason to be skeptical about following the FAA's lead when lifting the grounding.  Reports about the plane's certification have revealed a process in which Boeing, not the regulator, was calling many of the shots, and self-certifying the safety of many features. The FAA followed the company's desire to allow pilots of the original version of the 737 to fly the Max with only a brief online instruction rather requiring full simulator training. The ability to move pilots from one plane to the other was a selling point for Boeing as it took orders for the planes. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said last month that the company still believes that online training is all that will be needed when the plane starts flying again, but that it will follow whatever regulators require. Hart said he believes the FAA is \"still recognized as the gold standard\" for aircraft certification. But questions about its certification process for the Max were at the core of the meeting in Seattle. \"We are not here to determine when to un-ground the plane,\" he said. \"We are here to determine if the certification was robust and if it wasn't robust, what needs to be done to make it robust in the future.\" Boeing and the FAA both issued statements saying they were pleased to participate in the meeting. The FAA said the joint authorities will take a comprehensive look at its certification process. Boeing said it's confident the regulatory review will ensure the solution will \"get it right.\" But the process to get the planes back in the air around the globe will be an uphill battle for Boeing. \"It's hard to tell what is based upon genuine disagreement about safety, what is based upon lack of trust, and what is based upon not wanting to be seen as rubber stamping the FAA approval,\" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst for the Teal Group. \"But that's three reasons why it's going to be different this time.\" \n",

            "\t NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Boeing may need to ground its own aircraft. Europeans joined the Chinese and others in suspending flights of the 737 Max 8 after two crashes in recent months, and two U.S. senators called on the Federal Aviation Administration to follow suit. Boeing’s stock lost a further 6 percent, lopping off $14 billion or so of market value, on Tuesday. Rather than waiting for its regulator, the company could get ahead of the crisis. Such a step would be unconventional for an industry steeped in detailed rules and procedures. Boeing’s close relationship with the FAA may be part of the problem, though. The company persuaded the agency that its 737 Max line, the latest iteration of its best-selling workhorse, was similar enough to predecessors that airlines wouldn’t have to retrain pilots or inform them about changes to the flight control system, according to the New York Times. Investigators examining the crash of a Lion Air jet outside Jakarta in October have focused on the possibility that an automated flight system may have brought it down. The superficially similar-looking circumstances when an almost new Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 also crashed minutes after takeoff on Sunday prompted Chinese authorities to take the lead grounding the aircraft. The FAA says it’s too soon to tell if the accidents had a similar cause, but that Boeing would be upgrading the 737 Max 8’s software and updating training requirements and flight crew manuals. It’s understandable Boeing isn’t rushing to disrupt the 737 program, which accounts for 55 percent of its commercial aircraft revenue and probably more of its profit. The company also can’t technically ground an airplane. But it could recommend that action – and reassure airlines it’s working to discover the cause of the accidents and offer to compensate them. Morningstar analysts reckon the FAA’s three-month grounding of the 787 in 2013 cost Boeing $500 million, and estimate a similar suspension of the 737 could cost three times as much. Yet that’s very little compared with the $27 billion wiped off Boeing’s market value in two days. There could be a deeper problem, of course. But assuming any issue that’s found is simple to address, with over 4,600 737 Max orders in hand the company can quickly get back in its stride. A reputational hit, by contrast, could cause lasting damage. Boeing needs to move faster than its watchdog. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

            "\t OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will redouble its lobbying efforts in Congress to block any Trump administration move to pull the United States out of NAFTA, sources familiar with government strategy said, as talks to modernize the treaty run into trouble. Canadian officials, preparing for a fifth round of negotiations to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Treaty, are increasingly concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump may make good on a promise to pull out of the pact. The talks, resuming in Mexico City on Wednesday, stem from Trump’s insistence that the treaty - which he views as detrimental to U.S. workers - should either be improved to narrow U.S. trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, or scrapped. In the last round, in October, Washington made several proposals that Canada and Mexico rejected outright. Canadian officials say there is some considerable doubt as to whether Trump could pull out of NAFTA without approval from Congress, which makes lobbying its members so important.  “Should (withdrawal) ever happen ... the drive will be to really put the pressure on Congress, and so shift away from the White House,” said one source with knowledge of the government’s strategy, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. “You need the full court press because it’s both a Democrat and Republican issue - it’s as much about workers as it is big business.” Republicans currently control the White House as well as both chambers in Congress. For the last 15 months Canada has reached out to U.S. politicians at all levels to build support for bilateral trade and this effort will continue, say officials. Planning for a possible U.S. withdrawal is still in an early stage as officials grapple with the considerable uncertainty over what might happen at the talks, say Ottawa sources. “There are active conversations going on between various political offices and the public service about scenarios and steps that might be required,” said a second source, who declined to comment further. Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Monday the government and central bank were preparing a plan to address the possibility of a future without NAFTA, but gave few details. The Canadians were encouraged by a U.S. proposal to push back the deadline for reaching a deal to the end of March. By then, the Canadians hope, Trump may be so busy with domestic issues such as tax reform that NAFTA might slip down his list of priorities.    Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States, says NAFTA has been enormously beneficial to the three member nations. “Plan B right now is NAFTA. If NAFTA didn’t exist we’d try to create it,” said a third person involved in the talks. Officials dismiss the idea of following Mexico’s example and adopting a more combative stance with Trump. “To what advantage? What has happened with people who have been strident and militant with the president? He attacks right away. Our method is to work cooperatively behind the scenes,” said the third person. Although the end of NAFTA would be a blow to Canada, it could bolster long-stalled efforts to diversify trade.      Ottawa, already seeking closer economic ties with China and India, is now talking about treaties with regional bodies such as Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance. Even though deals are most likely years away, said the first source, “first mover advantage allows you to lock up the relationship, lock up the contracts, lock up the supply chains”. Officials say they want to avoid a repeat of what happened with South Korea, which signed a free trade deal with Canada a year after concluding a pact with the United States.

            "\t OTTAWA (Reuters) - Seventy percent of Canadians say they will start looking for ways to avoid buying U.S.-made goods in a threat to ratchet up a trade dispute between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump, an Ipsos Poll showed on Friday. The poll also found a majority of Americans and Canadians are united in support of Trudeau and opposition to Trump in their countries’ stand-off over the renegotiation of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Amid the spat, Trump pulled out of a joint communique with six other countries last weekend during a Quebec summit meeting of the Group of Seven rich nations and called Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump was reacting to Trudeau’s having called U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs insulting to Canada. Trudeau has said little about the matter since a Trump Twitter assault. Despite the tensions, 85 percent of Canadians and 72 percent of Americans said they support being in NAFTA, and 44 percent of respondents in both countries said renegotiation of the deal would be a good thing for their country. While the poll showed support for a boycott of U.S. goods in Canada, pulling it off could be difficult in a country that reveres U.S. popular culture and consumer goods over all others. Canada is the largest market for U.S. goods. The poll showed 72 percent of Canadians and 57 percent of Americans approved of the way Trudeau had handled the situation, while 14 percent of Canadians and 37 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s behavior. More than eight in 10 Canadians and seven in 10 Americans worry the situation has damaged bilateral relations. Canada has vowed to retaliate against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum with tariffs against a range of U.S. goods, a move supported by 79 percent of Canadians, according to the poll. By contrast, Americans opposed escalating the situation. Thirty-one percent of Americans said they favored even stronger tariffs, and 61 percent said other elected U.S. officials should denounce Trump’s statements. Canadian respondents also signaled approval of the united front their politicians have shown, with 88 percent saying they welcomed the support of politicians from other parties for the Liberal government’s decision to push back on tariffs. While Canadian consumers appeared ready to boycott U.S. goods, 57 percent of Canadians and 52 percent of Americans said Canada should not overreact to Trump’s comments because it was just political posturing. The Ipsos Poll of 1,001 Canadians and 1,005 Americans - including 368 Democrats, 305 Republicans and 202 Independents - was conducted June 13-14. It has a credibility interval of 3.4 percentage points. Reporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by Howard Goller\n",

            "\t * Greece's 10-year yield at lowest since January 2006 * Speculation mounts on new 10-year syndication * Other euro zone yields flat to slightly lower * Euro zone periphery government bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Adds quote, detail on Greece, broader euro zone bond markets) LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Greece's benchmark 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest since 2006 on Monday after Moody's raised its rating late last week, bolstering investor optimism towards the euro zone's most indebted country. Moody's on Friday lifted Greece's issuer ratings to B1 from B3, citing the effectiveness of the country's reform programme. Greece's 10-year yield dropped to 3.622 percent in early trade on Monday, the lowest since January 2006. A recently issued five-year bond's yield fell to its lowest in its two-week trading history at 2.79 percent. \"The move from Moody's is reflection that the reforms are already bearing fruit in the shape of some fiscal improvement with the primary surplus,\" said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. \"But I think what is also important is that Greece is showing it has access to markets, with the successful five-year (bond sale) and now rumours of a new 10-year as well,\" he said. The ratings upgrade fuelled speculation that Greece would offer a new 10-year bond syndication this week, with Commerzbank analysts also saying they expect a deal this week. Yields usually rise ahead of new supply, but for Greece, evidence of market access is considered positive, given the country's massive debt-to-GDP ratio -- 176 percent. Broader euro zone government bond yields were flat to slightly lower, though still near recent two-week highs on signs of a possible U.S.-China trade deal. World equity markets were might be signed around a summit on March 27. Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, was marginally lower at 0.18 percent, down from a one-month high of 0.208 percent on Friday.

            "\t * Data shows 1.5 pct German inflation in July * Economists had expected slip to 1.4 pct * Data firms expectations for central bank tightening * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices, adds U.S. data) By John Geddie and Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - Europe’s benchmark bond yield approached levels not seen since January 2016 on Friday after data showed higher-than-expected inflation in the bloc’s largest economy. A preliminary reading showed Germany’s year-on-year inflation at 1.5 percent in July, matching the previous month but beating forecasts of 1.4 percent in a Reuters’ poll of economists. The data confirmed a trend seen earlier on Friday, with the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg all reporting rising consumer price growth. More robust inflation supports the view that the European Central Bank may move to scale back some of its massive monetary stimulus later this year. Euro zone-wide data is due on Monday, with analysts predicting a slight slip to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent, well below the central bank’s near 2 percent price target. Friday’s data casts doubt over those forecasts. “We’ve also had an upside surprise in Spanish inflation numbers this morning and upbeat French GDP data so the combination is supportive of the ECB moving towards the exit,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. Spain earlier on Friday posted 1.7 percent year-on-year inflation in July, a touch above forecasts and last month’s 1.6 percent print. Data on inflation and growth in France — the bloc’s second largest economy — was bang in line with expectations. In Germany, North Rhine Westphalia saw annual inflation in July rise to 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent previously while Bavaria’s CPI rose to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent and Baden-Wuerttemberg’s to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent. Bond yields rose broadly as the German data filtered through, with 10-year yields up 2-4 basis points across the euro zone. German 10-year yields rose as much as 5 basis points to 0.587 percent, approaching levels not seen in 19 months. A long-term gauge of the market’s euro zone inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year breakeven forward rate, rose to a two-month peak at 1.6057 percent. Still, data showing U.S. labour costs increased less than expected in the second quarter, adding to concerns that U.S. inflation will remain low, taking the edge off the sell-off in euro zone markets in afternoon trade. Reports that North Korea has fired missiles also lifted demand for safe-have bonds, but yields in the euro zone remained higher on the day.

            "\t Hong Kong's government refused Friday to grant permission for a major protest march to take place over the weekend while two prominent activists, including Joshua Wong, were also charged for their participation in a June protest, per the AP. Why it matters: The twin moves, which authorities claim are linked to violence and unrest at earlier demonstrations, indicate that Hong Kong may be taking a \"harder line on this summer's protests,\" according to the AP. The planned march was meant to mark the fifth anniversary of China's decision not to allow fully democratic elections for Hong Kong's leader, though it is still unclear if some protestors may still take to the streets on their own.

            "\t HONG KONG — Days after Hong Kong’s worst riot in years, the Chinese government’s top official in the city said the violence was the work of “radical separatists” — the sort of label the Communist Party has applied to its opponents from Tibet to Taiwan whose real motive, it says, is to divide China. Chinese dissidents routinely deny such accusations. But at least one Hong Kong protester said he had no problem with those words, used by Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Central Liaison Office. “Radical? Yes. Separatist? I have no objection either,” said the protester, Edward Leung, a 24-year-old spokesman for the group Hong Kong Indigenous. He is among dozens of people charged with rioting in connection with the Feb. 9 clashes. The violence in the bustling Mong Kok district, which left more than 80 police officers and scores of protesters injured, was the most startling sign yet of the rise of a local movement with an appetite for confrontation — and the unlikely goal of a Hong Kong independent of China. Formed after the so-called Umbrella Movement protests of 2014, which failed in their goal to bring about more fully democratic local elections, Hong Kong Indigenous prefers aggression to peaceful demonstrations, which Mr. Leung said were tried in 2014 but failed. Politically, the group’s long-term goal is ambitious in the extreme: It wants Hong Kong residents to be given a vote on the city’s future — including the option of independence — after 2047, when Beijing’s promise of civil liberties and a high degree of autonomy for the former British colony is set to expire. Analysts dismiss that as a fantasy. More broadly, Hong Kong Indigenous, along with similar groups like Civic Passion, champions what has become known as “localism,” a reaction to mainland China’s growing influence here. Localists call for policies that favor Hong Kongers over mainland Chinese in areas like social benefits and school placement, and for defending Hong Kong traditions that they say are under threat. They have organized protests against shoppers from the mainland, and even against street performers who dance to songs in Mandarin Chinese, as opposed to Cantonese, the local dialect. A Hong Kong tradition was a factor in the Mong Kok violence, which took place on the first night of the Lunar New Year holiday. In past years, the authorities had turned a blind eye to unlicensed street vendors who sold snacks like fish balls and stinky tofu to the holiday crowds. But this time, reports circulated that city inspectors were preventing Mong Kok vendors from selling their wares. (Officials later said that the inspectors had only been patrolling, and that no tickets had been issued.) Using social media, Hong Kong Indigenous mobilized its followers to “protect” the vendors. Soon, some demonstrators were clashing with the police. At one point, an officer who was coming under attack fired live ammunition into the air — a shocking development in a city accustomed to peaceful protests. Before long, throngs of men in masks had set fires in the street and were hurling bricks at police officers, who struck back with batons and pepper spray and, in some cases, by throwing bricks themselves. Mr. Leung, who was rallying protesters with a loudspeaker before his arrest, denied that Hong Kong Indigenous had orchestrated the violence, though city officials later noted that the group had carried plastic shields to Mong Kok. About 20 of the 69 people who have been arrested in connection with the clashes are affiliated with the group, according to Mr. Leung. “If history decides we’re culpable for the violence, so be it,” Mr. Leung said, but “if we manage to achieve self-government, or even build a nation of our own, what happened in Mong Kok would be called a revolution.” But analysts say the idea that China would grant independence to Hong Kong is preposterous. “The courageous young people of Hong Kong need to read and understand the nature of politics and the political system in the People’s Republic of China if they want to get anywhere in defending Hong Kong rights,” said Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham. “Politics is the art of the possible.” Mr. Leung says he is taking the long view. He views a strong sense of local identity — and large numbers of protesters willing to fight — as future bargaining chips in negotiating the city’s fate. In that sense, he said, he welcomed the violence in Mong Kok. “We have proved that we have the mobilizing power to put pressure on the government,” he said. Not all localists endorse the idea of violent demonstrations. But there are signs that such tactics are gaining support among young democracy activists, many of whom were left disillusioned after the overwhelmingly peaceful Umbrella protests failed to get results. After the Mong Kok riot, the student unions of all but one of Hong Kong’s eight publicly funded universities issued statements in support of the protesters. (The exception, the City University of Hong Kong, has no student union.) The statements blamed the local government for the unrest, saying it had failed to address a variety of public concerns; one quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., saying, “A riot is the language of the unheard.” That contrasted sharply with the reaction of Hong Kong’s two largest pro-democracy parties, the Democratic Party and the Civic Party, which quickly condemned the attacks on the police. Those parties, some of whose members have campaigned for democracy for decades, are scorned by many younger pro-democracy activists, who say they have accomplished little. Localists have begun participating in Hong Kong’s electoral politics themselves, with some success. Last year, some localist candidates won seats on neighborhood councils, defeating candidates from established pro-democracy parties. Mr. Leung himself is running for the city legislature in a by-election next weekend. His platform includes building a desalination plant so that Hong Kong will not have to rely on water from mainland China, and discouraging the use of Mandarin in schools. “We must develop and reinforce a local identity, to draw a line between us and others,” Mr. Leung said. Joshua Wong, a student leader who played a prominent role in the Umbrella protests, is also forming a political party with the goal of putting a self-determination referendum for Hong Kong on the city legislature’s agenda — a development that would appall China’s leaders, for whom any talk of separatism is anathema. Mr. Tsang, the Chinese studies professor, said the right to self-determination was a reasonable expectation from a democrat’s perspective. “But Hong Kong is not a democracy, and Beijing will not allow Hong Kong to become one, despite the pretense otherwise,” he said. video\n",

In an interview with the right-wing One America News Network (OANN), Moore, who in December lost his special election bid to now-Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) after The Washington Post reported decades-old sexual misconduct allegations from multiple women, said that Democrats were dredging up the claims against Kavanaugh in a last-ditch attempt to derail his confirmation. \"It's so obvious that these tactics are used just days before a very important event like this, a Senate confirmation. It's right in the midst of a confirmation hearing,\" Moore said. \"And I think Republicans need to take a stand.\" Kavanaugh was accused over the weekend in a Washington Post interview by a Palo Alto University professor, Christine Blasey Ford, of sexually assaulting her at a high school party when the two were students. \"I think it's reflective of what's really happening that these allegations come in the midst of a Senate confirmation for the United States Supreme Court, just as they did in my case,\" the former state supreme court justice said. \"[Democrats] don't care about transparency, they just use it because it's effective,\" he continued. \"They know [that] on the one hand, you offend women if you believe someone who says they weren't guilty.\" \"On the other hand, if you don't believe [the accused], you're condemning them to guilt before [he has the ability] to prove his own innocence,\" Moore added. \"So it's a catch-22.\" Senators have scrambled to respond to the allegations against Kavanaugh that surfaced in the past week, with Democrats calling for the FBI to investigate Ford's claims while Republicans have called on Ford to testify to her story, either publicly before the Senate or in private.

            "\t In the wake of the Supreme Court justice’s corrosive confirmation battle, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that the fight would energize Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections next month. But a recent poll suggests that Kavanaugh himself is still deeply unpopular among Americans, and that expectations of a surge in GOP support have yet to come true. Fifty-one percent of Americans opposed Kavanaugh’s confirmation after it took place last Saturday, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released today. Only 41 percent of respondents backed him. That’s a higher level of support than in the days immediately after Christine Blasey Ford and Debbie Ramirez came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school and college, respectively. But the overall level of opposition is much greater than any other failed or successful Supreme Court nominee in recent American history. The poll found increased voter enthusiasm after the confirmation battle. Unfortunately for the GOP, it narrowly favored Democrats: 33 percent of Americans said the confirmation battle made them more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, while 27 percent said they would be more likely to vote for Republicans instead. Democrats already had a significant edge in voter enthusiasm this year, and the president’s party traditionally loses seats in Congress during the first midterm election of his tenure. For now, it looks like that pattern is holding. Kavanaugh’s extraordinarily partisan remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee also left quite an impact on Americans. The poll found that 43 percent of Americans think his presence on the court will increase the number of politically motivated Supreme Court rulings. They also appear to be largely unpersuaded by his denials of wrongdoing: 53 percent said they support further investigations into his past, including 58 percent of women. The Republican effort to rush Kavanaugh onto the court without a thorough inquiry already looked like a moral error. It may turn out to be a political one as well.\n",

            "\t Shares of Tesla fell 10 percent on Friday after the company announced layoffs, but the electric-car maker is still in the lead position on a technology that is taking over the world, said an early Tesla board member. Tesla's Friday announcement that it will cut 7 percent of its workforce is a sign CEO Elon Musk is taking steps to \"right-size\" the company and prepare it for the future, said former Tesla board member Steve Westly. \" He is moving faster than anybody else, going global faster than anybody else, and today, Tesla is essentially the iPhone of the electric-car market,\" said Westly, a California politician and venture capitalist who was an early investor in the company. While other premium automakers have now jumped into the electric-car market, they were caught \"with their shorts down when the tide went out,\" and Tesla now has a large lead in that market, Westly said. The company also posted a surprise profit in the third quarter, and Musk has said he expects Tesla to be cash-flow positive and profitable going forward. \"They've won the North American premium market race,\" he said. \"The challenge now is to win the mass market, to go international. I think he is preparing the company to do that. I wouldn't bet against him.\" However, not everyone agrees with Westly's assessment. Tesla's fourth-quarter update indicated that more than 75 percent of new Model 3 orders came from new customers rather than the existing reservations list. Almost all of those new orders were for mid- and high-price variants of the sedan, said Rajvindra Gill, an analyst for Needham. Gill estimates that about 90 percent of the 420,000 reservations on that list built up the last couple of years are customers who wanted the still-unreleased standard battery version of the vehicle, which is $35,000. The issue is that as the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles continues to wind down, Tesla could start to see customers cancel reservations in the first and second quarter if the company cannot make the planned $35,000 base model quickly enough. The other issue is that Tesla's profitable quarter depended in part on selling the more expensive versions of the Model 3, which should make up a smaller piece of the total if Tesla begins producing the cheaper version. \"So I think there's a lot of risk to the name given the level of valuation we see in this name, given the level of debt the company has, and given the level of competition that will be entering the market this year and next year,\" Gill said.\n",

            "\t Tesla almost reached Elon Musk's goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week during the last week of its second quarter, reports Reuters. The 5,000th car made it through final quality checks around 5 a.m. PT — mere hours after Musk's midnight deadline. Why it matters: Achieving the 5000-per-week production level for the Model 3 during the second quarter was vital for Tesla, even if it came a few hours late. The company has previously fallen short of production targets during the slower-than-expected ramp-up. Yes, but: It remains to be seen how much confidence among investors and analysts that the seeming success in hitting the deadline will create. As Reuters notes, a key question is how long Tesla can sustain that production level. The company took aggressive measures at its California factory to meet the target, and it’s unclear to what extent the final push to boost Model 3 output may have required pulling resources from other models.\n",

            "\t Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday warned Roy Moore not to run for Senate again in Alabama, calling him the only candidate who could lose the race for Republicans. Moore lost the 2017 special Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones after the former judge faced allegations of decades-old inappropriate sexual interactions with young girls. He has expressed interest in running again next year, and many Republicans expect him to mount another campaign for Senate, a worst-case scenario for the party’s hopes of winning back the seat. “You are literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,” Trump Jr. tweeted at Moore on Tuesday. “Running for office should never become a business model. If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.” Trump Jr. was responding to a tweet in which Moore taunted Rep. Bradley Byrne, one of the Republicans running to face Jones next fall. Byrne told The Hill that he expects Moore to enter the race soon but didn’t think he could win the nomination because of the baggage from his previous run. “What is Bradley so worried about?” Moore tweeted. “He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones.” Republicans in Washington have vowed to oppose Moore and think the former judge would put the Alabama race in jeopardy again. Jones won by less than 2 percentage points in 2017 and is the most vulnerable incumbent senator on the ballot in 2020. Earlier this year, Jones taunted Moore about running again, saying, “Let’s just do it again.” \n",

            "\t Add U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and House Speaker Paul Ryan to the growing list of Republicans calling for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to abandon his bid for Sessions' former seat. Sessions on Tuesday told a House committee he had \"no reason to doubt\" the accounts of women who have accused Moore of groping or pursuing romantic relationships with them when they were teens. Sessions also hinted that the Justice Department might look into allegations against the besieged Republican Alabama Senate candidate. \"We will evaluate every case as to whether or not it should be investigated,\" Sessions told members of the House Judiciary Committee. Also Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan added his voice to the effort to persuade Moore to drop out of the race. \"These allegations are credible,\" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters on Tuesday. \"If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about then he should step aside.\" Later Tuesday, Politico, citing a senior Republican Party official, reported that the Republican National Committee would back off its support for Moore and withdraw from a joint fundraising agreement it has with the Senate candidate. Politico also said the RNC would cancel field operations in support of Moore it had planned for Dec. 12, the day of the election. Sessions' and Ryan's comments added to a growing chorus of Republicans who have called on Moore to step aside in his bid to fill the seat Sessions vacated earlier this year when he became attorney general in President Donald Trump's administration. Sessions had held the seat since 1997. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who chairs the Senate GOP's campaign organization, has said that, if Moore is elected, senators should expel him \"because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements\" of the Senate. Such an expulsion would require a two-thirds majority, which means 19 Republicans would need to join the 46 Democratic and two independent senators to successfully block Moore from being seated. As of Tuesday, some 15 GOP senators, along with other several other prominent party members, have said that Moore should withdraw from the race, saying, in effect, that the series of allegations are more credible than Moore's repeated, vehement denials. Other GOP senators have said Moore should step aside \"if the allegations are true.\" Six have not commented on the allegations. On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson detailed new allegations against Moore in an emotional appearance in New York. When she was 16, Nelson said, Moore offered to drive her home from an after-school job at a restaurant where he was a regular customer. Instead, she said, he parked behind the restaurant, locked the door to keep her inside, and attempted to force her to perform oral sex on him. Moore denied the accusations. \"I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I don't even know the woman,\" he said. Moore is showing no sign of quitting the race and has denied multiple allegations. His campaign sent out fundraising emails emphasizing his stance as a maverick battling establishment politicians. In one email sent Tuesday, Moore referred to Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell, R-Ky., and GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as \"the forces of evil who are attempting to rip and tear apart me and my campaign with their filthy lies and disgusting attacks.\" — The Associated Press contributed to this report.

            "\t Attorney General Bill Barr finally released Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia report on Thursday, reasserting his position that the special counsel found no evidence of collusion or the basis for an obstruction of justice charge. But the actual report is quite damning. It establishes, among other things, a clear fact pattern showing repeated connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. It also outlines 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice that suggest, at the very least, that President Trump actively sought to undermine Mueller’s investigation. Despite Barr’s statements, top legal thinkers aren’t so sure that the conclusion should be so cut and dried. I asked 12 legal experts to examine what the report had to say about collusion and obstruction of justice. Specifically, I wanted to know if Barr’s decision not to pursue obstruction charges was justified, and if the evidence of coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign amounted to criminal conspiracy. There was a near-consensus on both questions. While Mueller may not have had sufficient evidence to charge anyone with conspiracy, the experts agree that plenty of evidence exists. The same is true of the obstruction question. As one expert put it, “the Mueller report provides a road map for prosecuting Trump for obstruction of justice, but stops short of this finding because of legal doubts about indicting a sitting president.” You can read their full responses, lightly edited for clarity, below. If we were talking about Mr. Trump, not President Trump, we’d be talking about an indictment for obstruction of justice. Today we know that Attorney General Barr put a highly positive (for Trump) gloss on the report. Today we know that Mueller found substantial wrongdoing that would plague, and perhaps end, any other presidency in American history. Today we know that perhaps the difference between a suggestion that Trump be prosecuted for obstruction of justice and a suggestion that he not be was 1) Mueller’s inability to sit down and speak with the Trump without subpoenaing him and Mueller’s decision not to subpoena Trump, and 2) actions by Trump’s staffers that may have protected the president from legal liability. The headline of the report is helpful to Trump. The actual substance of the report is damning. The special counsel’s report breaks into two volumes. Whereas the first volume, which focuses on Russia’s interference in the presidential election, contains quite a few redactions, the second volume, which focuses on the obstruction of justice questions, contains very few redactions. Presumably, this was intentional on the special counsel’s part, and one cannot help but wonder whether Attorney General Barr could and should have released the second volume several weeks ago, particularly because of the damning nature of the information contained in that volume. Even if each of the events described and analyzed by the special counsel independently falls short of establishing obstruction as a legal matter (and that’s a debatable proposition), viewed in the aggregate, they indicate a stunning willingness to ignore and subvert the rule of law. President Trump’s supporters can call it an exoneration, but his opponents may well view it as a road map for impeachment. Ever since Attorney General William Barr released his purported “summary” of the Mueller report’s conclusions, most media accounts have assumed that Mr. Mueller ultimately decided there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians. We have been told that the Mueller report had thus “exonerated” President Trump of conspiracy charges, though not on charges that he obstructed justice. Some media reports went further, stating that Mr. Mueller had found “no evidence” of a conspiracy. The Democrats, some said, had now been proved wrong even for supporting the special counsel’s independent investigation into the matter. Those accounts gave the president an undeserved free pass, for even Mr. Barr’s cherry-picked quotes had made no such claims. We can now see that all Mr. Mueller decided on that issue was that “the investigation did not establish” such a conspiracy. To non-lawyers this might seem like splitting hairs, but lawyers understand how important that difference is. “Establish” is prosecutor talk that simply means “I won’t bring an indictment because I don’t think a jury would find the proof of conspiracy to be ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’” — an extremely high standard of proof. As the Mueller report emphasizes in the introduction, “A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.” To the contrary, we now know that Mr. Mueller found abundant evidence of precisely such a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians. The section titled “Trump Campaign and the Dissemination of Hacked Materials” was very heavily redacted, but even the non-redacted evidence of conspiracy was substantial: campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s “periodically” sharing internal polling data and other campaign updates with the Russians; the campaign’s promotion of “dozens of tweets, posts, and other political content created by” the Russian hacking operation; Trump publicly urging Russia to search for Hillary Clinton’s “missing” emails; the campaign’s successful effort to tone down the anti-Russian language in the Republican Party platform at the nominating convention; the president’s bizarre support for Putin, resistance to sanctions, and corresponding antagonism toward our NATO allies; the multiple meetings between top campaign officials and Russians with Kremlin ties, including their famous meeting at the New York Trump hotel for the express, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, purpose of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton; and the lies they were caught in when they tried to deny either the meetings themselves or their content. Whether or not that pile of evidence rises to the level of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” it is of grave concern. There is thus ample reason for Congress — which is not subject to the same standard of proof as a criminal prosecutor — to continue investigating this issue, as well as the obstruction of justice question and all the other disturbing allegations surrounding President Trump and his associates. There are also the continuing, very legitimate investigations by various US attorneys’ offices and state attorney general offices. And, of course, there is still hope that at least Congress, and perhaps the public, will find a way to see the crucial information that Mr. Barr has redacted from the Mueller report. So there is much more to come. The Mueller report paints a disturbing picture of President Trump trying to undermine investigations with a more reassuring portrayal of lawyers and aides seeking to preserve the rule of law. According to Mueller, ex-White House counsel Don McGahn and others “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.” The president’s directive to FBI Director Jim Comey to go easy on National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI met the legal test for obstruction of justice. But Comey refused Trump’s request, just as McGahn shrugged off Trump’s order to fire Mueller. The Mueller report provides a road map for prosecuting Trump for obstruction of justice but stops short of this finding because of legal doubts about indicting a sitting president. Trump could be charged after he has left the White House, although Attorney General William Barr’s refusal to charge Trump now might make future prosecution seem imprudent or vindictive. In addition, Congress could start impeachment based on Mueller’s road map, although political factors might weigh against that move. The Mueller report also prompts a mixed verdict on Attorney General Barr. Given the disturbing evidence of Trump’s obstruction in the report, both today’s Barr press conference and the letter Barr released almost four weeks ago seem like exercises in spin. But Barr also released the Mueller report with far fewer redactions than many feared. It’s up to Congress, the media, and the public to read the entire report to get a full picture of the president’s repeated efforts to undermine the justice system and the concerted attempts by government lawyers and other aides to pull him back from the precipice. If this is what a complete and total exoneration looks like, I’d hate to see a damning report. We have often been cautioned not to rush to judgment because we did not know what the Mueller team knows. It turns out that the broad contours of the investigation’s findings had largely found their way into the public sphere, but the report collects all that information in a single place and provides new details that do not put the president in a favorable light. The good news for the White House is that Mueller could not prove a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign to have Russia influence the 2016 elections and that Mueller did not recommend obstruction of justice charges. The bad news is that the campaign demonstrated an unseemly willingness to benefit from Russian interference and that Russia made lots of efforts to interfere in the election. Moreover, the president has behaved remarkably badly in regard to the investigation into the 2016 campaign. Mueller was appropriately cautious about reaching legal conclusions regarding obstruction of justice given the aggressive legal interpretation that would be needed to pursue a case against some of the president’s actions and given that Justice Department policies would preclude those legal conclusions from being translated into indictments of a sitting president. The president might have an innocent explanation for some of his actions, or at least a credible claim of mixed motives, but he repeatedly took actions that he was strongly advised would be highly inappropriate and was saved from more damaging consequences by the willingness of others to ignore the president’s preferences. The courtroom is probably not the right venue for calling the president to account for his actions, but the report leaves little doubt that the president does not appreciate the responsibilities of his office. “Putin has won.” Election Day 2016, an intercepted message to Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian national “closely connected to Putin.” (On page 149 of the Mueller report.) This line says everything that the American public should remember about the Mueller investigation. Russian interference in the election has been established beyond doubt. Worse, Mueller found that the Trump campaign “expected to benefit” from criminal actions by Russians who successfully targeted the American election. It is not a crime for any citizen to associate with criminals and spies, nor to enjoy their favors, but that is surely too low a standard for a president of the United States. Viewing this case through the lens of criminal law is a mistake. The president takes an oath “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Few constitutionalists believe that the special counsel would indict a sitting president for an ordinary crime. The constitutional power to judge a president is left to Congress. Congress must determine whether there has been a constitutional offense. We now know that, contrary to his oath to “take care” that the laws be faithfully executed, the president tried to fire the special counsel, and he fired the head of the FBI, among other acts to thwart the investigation of criminal election interference by our enemies. These are not the acts of one faithful to the law. They are acts of one who would put his own election above the integrity of America’s democracy. After reading the full report, it is much harder to understand why Mueller determined that there was insufficient evidence to believe that the president was guilty of obstruction of justice. The primary reason seems to be lack of evidence that the president had a “corrupt intent.” But in reviewing the 10 episodes in which the president may have obstructed justice, the report concludes numerous times that there is “substantial evidence” that the president acted with the intent to impede ongoing criminal investigations, or that a “reasonable inference” is that the president acted with such an intent. Furthermore, the report noted that the president refused to cooperate with the investigation with regard to answering questions on potential obstruction of justice charges, and that the Mueller team declined to issue a subpoena in order to pursue the issue. But if the question of the president’s intent was unresolved, and thus the question of whether the president was guilty of obstruction remained unresolved, a subpoena of the president would be a critical next step in the investigation. While there may have been good reasons not to pursue a subpoena against the president, this omission in the investigation leaves open a very significant question regarding whether the president is guilty of obstruction charges. The redacted version of the Mueller report released today paints an unflattering picture of President Trump, particularly on the question of obstruction of justice. Although special counsel Robert Mueller did not reach any conclusion on whether the president should be prosecuted for obstruction, he did conclude that “Our investigation found multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russia-interference and obstruction investigations.” Trump’s efforts to hamstring the investigation mostly failed. But that was “largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders and accede to his requests.” The fact that White House counsel Donald McGahn and other legally sophisticated officials refused to carry out the president’s orders is a strong sign they considered them improper and likely illegal. The report also includes a compelling response to claims that the president could not have committed obstruction of justice, if he did not commit any underlying crime related to Russia. As the report notes, “obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a grey area, or to avoid personal embarrassment.” All of these motives were very plausibly present in the case of Trump. Trump had a strong incentive to impede the investigation in order to prevent its revelations from “calling into question the legitimacy of his election,” and because of “potential uncertainty” about whether some of the information revealed “could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.” An additional possible motive was preventing revelation of crimes by his close associates that were not directly related to “collusion.” The Mueller investigation did in fact reveal many such crimes, and several close associates of Trump’s have been convicted of various offenses. On the question of collusion, the report is largely good news for Trump. The investigation did not find enough evidence to justify filing charges. But the report documents extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. The latter sought to help the former, and the campaign hoped to benefit from Russia’s actions. The fact that a hostile authoritarian regime believed Trump’s victory would advance their interests, and made extensive efforts to secure that outcome, is highly damning, even if Trump and his associates did not commit any crimes in the process. In the short run, Trump is unlikely to face legal liability. Justice Department policy forbids prosecution of a sitting president. Impeachment is not so constrained. But successful impeachment leading to removal requires the support of numerous Republican senators, which seems unlikely. Trump does, however, face potential prosecution after he leaves office. The political impact of the report also remains to be seen. If the DOJ was a law firm, it would be the largest law firm in the world. Honorable men don’t always run the DOJ. For instance, Nixon’s Attorney General John Mitchell authorized the Watergate break-in when he was still at DOJ. Mitchell served 19 months in prison for his Watergate-related crimes including obstruction of justice. William Barr may be on Mitchell’s path to ignominy. Barr’s cursory four-page summary was deeply misleading compared to even the redacted version of the Mueller report that has been released to the public. The redacted Mueller report provides what will surely be a first draft of history of the Trump campaign and Trump presidency, and the report does so in damning detail that was absent from Barr’s initial memo, including the multiple contacts between the Trump 2016 campaign, the Trump Organization, and the Trump transition with various Russians. Barr’s initial characterization of Mueller’s decision not to pursue obstruction of justice seemed to indicate that there was insufficient evidence. But the actual Mueller report seems to indicate that part of why the special counsel declined to make a decision on prosecuting obstruction was because of the DOJ’s longstanding policy that a president cannot be indicted. Indeed, the report states, “given [that the President cannot be indicted under OLC policy], the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough and factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.” This seems to indicate that the special counsel was trying to preserve evidence of potential obstruction crimes for possible future prosecution when Trump was no longer president or for use by Congress. The Mueller report in Volume I indicates that the special counsel did not decide to pursue potential campaign finance violations including the long-term ban on receipt of things of value from foreign nationals by American political campaigns because of uncertainty about information provided by members of the Trump campaign such as Don Jr. and [Jared] Kushner. In other words, they may not have known that they were breaking the law when they allegedly broke the law. And without that knowledge, it would be impossible to charge them with a knowing violation of the law. The Mueller report on Volume II, page eight is clear that “Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President’s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent present difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” In other words, the Mueller report does not exonerate President Trump on the matter of obstruction of justice. The report also reminds the president that under the United States Constitution, he must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” And that “the concept of ‘faithful execution’ connotes the use of power in the interest of the public, not the office holder’s personal interests.” (Vol II at 177). And the report ends thusly: “the protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person — including the President — accords with the fundamental principle of our government that ‘[n]o [person] in this country is so high that he is above the law.’” This report gives Congress multiple avenues of investigation to pursue. Accusations of obstruction of justice were counts of impeachment against both Presidents Clinton and Nixon. The open question is whether the Congress will have the stomach to peruse the 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice laid bare in the redacted Mueller report against President Trump now. Moreover, from the redactions that refer to “on-going matters,” clearly other legal shoes are yet to drop. First, the report concludes that Trump personally exerted “undue influence” over law enforcement investigations. Whether that’s a crime or not, it’s certainly intolerable and something that the House of Representatives should take action on. There can be a debate about whether that action should be impeachment or censure, but that political debate has to happen now. Second, the Mueller report focuses almost exclusively on conspiracy law while ignoring the crime of solicitation under Florida state penal law. In his July 2016 speech in Florida, Trump requested that Russia commit computer hacking to find Clinton’s emails. That may not be a conspiracy, but it is a criminal solicitation under state penal law. It’s also wrong and unacceptable. The report concludes that Trump tried to have Mueller fired. The Nixon “precedent” is that removing a special counsel constitutes obstruction of justice. If Trump’s attempt to fire Mueller isn’t obstruction of justice, then the new “rule” will be that it’s okay to fire a special counsel investigating the president. That’s completely antithetical to the rule of law. The Mueller report, with redactions and without appendices, does not exonerate President Trump. Instead, it raises more questions about more forms of culpability. The one I find most concerning is the cyberwar launched by Russia against the United States around the 2016 campaign and election. These sections of the report documented the scope of the hostile activities aimed at the heart of our democracy. What was missing was a recounting of the president’s refusal to acknowledge the attack and to take reasonable steps to prevent a recurrence in 2020. If there were to be impeachment proceedings, articles of impeachments under the “take care” clause and the “commander in chief” should be included in the case against Trump, whose budget cuts and failures to act in the national interest of the United States should not be overlooked or excused. These failures need to be explained to all of us so that we can decide in the 2020 election whether Trump is acting in the interest of the United States. Finally, the analysis of obstruction of justice efficiently destroys many of the arguments made by the current attorney general in his job application memorandum of June 2018. It appears to provide sufficient evidence for a strong case that Trump obstructed justice in multiple ways. There are instances where the language of the Mueller report appears to be inconsistent with the spin offered this morning by the attorney general. The paths forward are becoming clearer. Congress should continue to investigate the financial connections between Trump and Russia. But the issue of Trump’s conduct will be in the hands of the voters. This is no time for us to become weary of the betrayals and dysfunctions of this administration. Removing Trump from our national life by defeating him at the polls in 2020 may be the best way to preserve our republic. He can always be tried for his crimes when he is out of office. The report indicates that there is overwhelming evidence that Trump took extraordinary efforts to try and undermine Mueller’s investigation. Just one quick example: Trump told his White House counsel to fire Mueller, then he told him to lie about it. Similarly, he tried to reverse the impact of his attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the investigation. And on and on and on. There are just so many instances of Trump seeking to undermine the investigation. The report also indicates that Mueller did not reach an obstruction conclusion due to concerns arising from the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Mueller concluded that Congress could enforce the obstruction of justice statute when Trump acted corruptly to undermine an investigation. Barr’s suggestions to the contrary were false.\n",

            "\t WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investigators probing whether Donald Trump’s presidential campaign colluded with Russia have been questioning witnesses about events at the 2016 Republican National Convention, according to two sources familiar with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiries.  Mueller’s team has been asking about a convention-related event attended by both Russia’s U.S. ambassador and Jeff Sessions, the first U.S. senator to support Trump and now his attorney general, said one source, who requested anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.   Another issue Mueller’s team has been asking about is how and why Republican Party platform language hostile to Russia was deleted from a section of the document related to Ukraine, said another source who also requested anonymity.   Mueller’s interest in what happened at the Republican convention in Cleveland, Ohio in July 2016, is an indication that Trump campaign contacts and actions related to Russia remain central to the special counsel’s investigation.   Trump, who was nominated as the Republican Party candidate for the November 2016 election during the convention, has denied any collusion with Russia during the campaign. Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agencies’ findings that it interfered in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trump’s favor.   Investigators have asked detailed questions about conversations that Sessions, then a Trump campaign adviser, had at a convention event attended by then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak, said the first source, who was questioned by Mueller about the event.  The same source said Mueller’s team also has been asking whether Sessions had private discussions with Kislyak on the sidelines of a campaign speech Trump gave at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel in April 2016.  Sessions’ spokespersons have denied repeatedly that he had any private discussions with Kislyak at the Mayflower. Sessions told lawmakers last year he could not recall any conversations with Russian officials at the hotel but could not rule out that a “brief interaction” with Kislyak may have occurred there.  Spokespersons for Mueller and Sessions declined to comment on Mueller’s interest in Sessions’ activities at the convention and other convention-related events.   The special counsel’s investigators have also interviewed attendees of the committee meetings that drafted the Republican Party platform in Cleveland.   At one committee meeting, according to people in attendance, Diana Denman, a member of the platform committee’s national security subcommittee, proposed language calling for the United States to supply “lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine’s armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning.”  But the final platform language deleted the reference to “lethal defensive weapons,” a change that made the platform less hostile to Russia, whose troops had invaded the Crimean peninsula and eastern Ukraine.   After the convention, Denman told Reuters in 2016, J.D. Gordon, a Trump foreign policy adviser, told her he was going to speak to Trump about the language on Ukraine, and that Trump’s campaign team played a direct role in softening the platform language.   The Trump campaign has denied playing any role in the weakening of the party’s position regarding Ukraine. Gordon has called Denman’s version of events “inaccurate.”  Stephen Yates, co-chair of the platform committee’s national security subcommittee, said he has “heard nothing about other members of the subcommittee being called in for questioning, and I have had no interaction with anyone working on the investigation.”  Sessions recused himself last year from the federal probe into Russian election meddling after it emerged that he had failed to say during his Senate confirmation hearing to be attorney general that he had met with Russia’s ambassador in 2016.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph 8 to show Sessions did not rule out a “brief interaction” with Kislyak instead of he admitted to speaking briefly to Kislyak)  Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by John Walcott and Frances Kerry\n",

            "\t You might not think that a bureaucratic report with the snooze-inducing title “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections” would turn out to be a can’t-put- it-down must read, but that’s what it is for Washington and a lot of the rest of the nation. I refer, of course, to the report produced collectively by The Central Intelligence Agency, The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and The National Security Agency, which concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to influence the US presidential election. One goal was to help Mr. Trump win. The Russian efforts reportedly included hacking into Democratic National Committee emails and transmitting them, directly or indirectly, to WikiLeaks and its head Julian Assange, who then published them to the world. Some of those emails turned were quite damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.  The intelligence community’s report has stimulated all sorts of reactions in political circles. Most notably, both before and after the declassified version had been released to the public, President-elect Trump fired off tweets that seemed to dismiss and even mock the conclusion that Russia had worked to help him win. However, on last Sunday’s “Fox News Sunday,” Reince Priebus, the incoming Chief of Staff in Trump’s White House, said he “thinks” Mr. Trump “accepts the findings” of the intelligence report. Stay tuned for the next tweet. For the average citizen—those of us who do not bear any direct responsibility for safeguarding US cyber-security—probably the most interesting question raised by the entire Russian hacking issue is, did the hacking affect the outcome of the 2016 election? The intelligence community’s report states explicitly that they do not address that question, and it also explains why: “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.” This question—did Russian hacking affect the outcome?—is not quite as simple as it looks. We ought to take pains to distinguish between two different questions that might otherwise be jumbled together. One question is: did the Russian hacking help Trump’s campaign? The other question is: was the Russian hacking decisive in Trump’s victory, or, put another way, would Trump have lost without Russian hacking? Both of these questions involve counter-factual conditionals of enormous complexity. They ask, in effect, what would have happened had the Russians done nothing? There is no laboratory in which we can run the 2016 election over again, leaving out the Russian hacking, and then observe the results. (This is, no doubt, a second reason the intelligence report ducks this issue.) So, when we address these questions, a profound sense of modesty is the only proper attitude. Some will say that it is obvious that Russian activities helped Trump at least to some degree, because the leaked emails embarrassed the Clinton campaign. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi asked and answered her own question: “Did it affect the Clinton campaign? Of course it did.” John Podesta, whose own personal email account was hacked and who served as chairman of the Clinton campaign, said that the election results were “distorted” by Russian interference. Mr. Trump disagrees. As he uses the phrase, the Russians could have “affected the election results” only if they tampered with electronic voting machines. I don’t believe many others would understand that phrase in those very narrow terms, but Mr. Trump is convinced that, because the Russians didn’t hack into voting machines, they had no effect on the results. Even if we assume the hacking had some impact on the results, we immediately come to the Mt. Everest of relevant questions: did Russian hacking have a decisive impact on the results? Kellyanne Conway, who will be White House counselor in the incoming administration, is certain that the answer is “no.” On last Sunday’s “State of the Union” on CNN, she said this about the Clinton campaign and Russian hacking: “We didn’t need WikiLeaks to convince the American people that they didn’t like her, didn’t trust her, didn’t find her to be honest… The alleged attacks, alleged aspirations to interfere with our democracy failed.” If the hackers failed in their aspiration to interfere, then Trump’s victory obviously was not a product of their hacking.

Schiff offers bill to make domestic terrorism a federal crime New intel chief inherits host of challenges MORE (D-Calif.), who serves as the ranking Democratic member on the House Intelligence Committee, has said “The daily dumping of damaging material to Secretary Clinton was enormously consequential in terms of her campaign.

To ignore that, or to say it didn’t happen, is quite inaccurate. All of this was of course enabled by the Russian cyber operations.” Saying the hacks were “enormously beneficial to Donald Trump” is not exactly the same as saying that he could not have won without them, but it’s pretty darn close. The truth is that neither Ms. Conway nor Rep. Schiff, nor anyone else in this whole great big world, knows whether Mr. Trump would have won if there had been no Russian influence campaign. Democrats and Republicans shouldn’t be fighting each other over this issue. In this instance, our common enemy clearly is Russia. David E.

            "\t President Trump today, at a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he didn't see \"any reason\" why Russia would interfere in the 2016 election, in response to a question on whether he believed Putin or U.S. intelligence agencies. Our thought bubble from Jonathan Swan in Helsinki: \"I just have no words. As press in this room, we are all sitting in here speechless and stunned. Trump cast doubt over the U.S. intelligence community and endorsed Putin’s denial. Trump was given an opportunity to denounce the meddling and he didn’t; he just pivoted to lines about the missing server and Hillary’s emails. While Putin spoke forcefully, lying, Trump nodded along. There’s no way of sugar coating or spinning this.\" Why it matters:  This comes just days after Trump's own administration indicted 12 Russians for hacking the DNC with the intent of interfering with the election. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly concluded that Russia actively sought to interfere in the election, and plans to again. When asked if he wanted Trump to win the election, Putin said, \"Yes I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" More key quotes from Trump: He said that the relationship between the U.S. and Russia “has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about four hours ago.” On that deteriorating relationship, Trump said: \"I hold both countries responsible. I think the United States has been foolish... I think we've all been foolish. We're all to blame.\" He called Putin  a \"good competitor,\" not an adversary. \"I beat Hillary Clinton easily... We won that race. And it's a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over it.\" \"There was no collusion. I didn't know the president. There was nobody to collude with.\" Trump called the Russia investigation \"a disaster for our country.\" When asked whether he believes the U.S. intelligence community or Putin over what happened in 2016, Trump said \"I don't see any reason why it would be [Russia], I really want to see the server.\" He added, \"President Putin was extremely strong in his denial.\"  And Putin: “The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs including [the] election process.” \"Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense. Just like the President recently mentioned.\" However, Putin offered to interrogate the 12 Russians indicted by the Justice Department. Combatting the idea that Trump and Putin trust one another, Putin said, “You can trust no one.” When asked about reports that Russia has compromising material on Trump: \"Now to the compromising material, I did hear this rumor.  When Trump visited Moscow back then, I didn’t even know he was in Moscow.” Get more stories like this by signing up for our weekly political lookahead newsletter, Axios Sneak Peek.\n",

            "\t House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) will temporarily step aside from an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including interactions between Moscow and the Trump campaign.  The move comes as the House Ethics Committee announced that it is investigating allegations that Nunes may have mishandled classified information. With the Ethics Committee now formally involved in the dispute, Nunes could no longer oversee the Russia probe, although he will remain in place as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation will be taken over by Reps. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.). In a statement, Nunes blamed complaints filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics over his decision to brief President Donald Trump on intelligence intercepts of conversations between Trump campaign aide and Russian officials during the election.  “Several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics,\" Nunes said in a statement Thursday. \"The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power.\" Nunes added: \"Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee’s Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter. I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.” However, Ethics Committee Chairwoman Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), the ranking member on Ethics, said Nunes is under scrutiny by their panel. \"The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Devin Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct,\" Brooks and Deutch said in joint statement. \"The Committee, pursuant to Committee Rule 18(a), is investigating and gathering more information regarding these allegations.\" Brooks and Deutch are using the Ethics Committee's authority to review any issue that has to to do with the integrity of the House, but they have not set up a special subcommittee to handle the matter and are under no requirement to issue any findings related to their investigation. Rep. Adam Schiff, the intelligence panel’s top Democrat, said he believes Nunes’ decision will allow the committee to have a “fresh start” on its Russia probe.  “I just want to express my appreciation for what the chairman has decided to do. I’m sure it was a very difficult decision for him,” the California Democrat told reporters. “We need to get fully back on track.”  Schiff added that he would continue working with Nunes “on a whole range of other issues that our committee has to do with.” Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement that Nunes \"continues to have [my] trust, and I know he is eager to demonstrate to the Ethics Committee that he has followed all proper guidelines and laws. In the meantime, it is clear that this [ethics] process would be a distraction for the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in our election.\" Austin Wright contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t Democrats are plotting their next move after questioning House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes’ fitness to lead the panel’s investigation into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election. One step they almost certainly won’t take: a boycott. Even as they ramp up calls for an outside investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, Democrats say it would not make sense for them to walk away from the House probe led by Nunes, the California Republican many now view as a lackey for Trump. If Democrats boycotted the investigation, they say, they would risk losing access to the evidence being turned over to the intelligence panel — giving Republicans complete control over how that evidence is presented to the public. “Democrats feel that if we're not engaged in this investigation, no one will be,” Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, said Friday. “In the minority, the only power we have is the power of public persuasion.” Democrats on the committee huddled Friday morning to discuss how to respond to recent actions by Nunes, including his decision to cancel a planned public hearing next week with former members of the Obama administration. As they entered and exited the meeting, they expressed a determination to trudge on.  “If we're not here shining a light on this, the light goes out,” said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), a member of the intelligence panel. “Our plan is to use pressure to make this the most credible investigation possible.” Added Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), also a committee member: “We want to illuminate the obstruction. We want to preserve our access.” For Democrats, the episode is the latest example of how little power the minority is afforded in the House of Representatives, which isn’t subject to the Senate filibuster that gives them more leverage in the upper chamber. Rep. Jackie Speier of California, another Intelligence Committee Democrat, said that while she has lost confidence in Nunes’ leadership of the investigation, she is not ready to commit to a boycott. “It’s very important for us to recognize that if we are not part of the process, then it is only the Senate that is doing an investigation,” Speier said. Nunes, she added, “knows full well that there is grave question about his objectivity, and I think over the next few days, we're going to assess whether or not we feel confident that he can continue in that role.” The latest dust-up with Nunes began Wednesday when the intelligence chairman — without any notice to committee Democrats — held a news conference and then briefed the White House on what he called new evidence, provided to him by an unnamed source, that members of the Trump transition might have been improperly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies following the November election. Nunes, who himself was a member of the Trump transition team, apologized to Democrats on Thursday morning for not giving Schiff a heads up before going public with his new information. He said he hopes Democrats on the panel will be provided access to the new information on Friday. He did not apologize, though, for taking the information to the White House — something Democrats have decried as inappropriate given that his panel is investigating possible collusion between the Trump team and Moscow. Nunes told Fox News he believed he had a \"duty and obligation\" to inform President Donald Trump, saying he believes Americans might be troubled by the information he saw. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) responded on Thursday by calling Nunes a \"stooge for the president of the United States.\" Some Democrats have demanded that Nunes lose his chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee, something that almost certainly will not happen given that Nunes kept House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) informed about what he was up to. Even some fellow Republicans have questioned whether Nunes’ actions have compromised the integrity of his probe. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), for example, said on NBC that Nunes' actions were \"very disturbing\" and told reporters at the Capitol this was yet another reason to create a special committee to handle the investigation. Meanwhile, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) delivered an indirect rebuke to the House intelligence chairman. “It's most appropriate for the committees to work independent of the White House, not next to the White House,” said Lankford, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own Russia investigation. “Anything that happens within our committee needs to be completely not only bipartisan but nonpartisan.” Several Senate Democrats emphasized that, despite getting off to a rough start, they are happy with the status of their chamber’s Russia investigation, which this week began doing private witness interviews. And while they are clamoring for an independent investigation of the issue, it’s clear Democrats fear they could lose out if they walked away from the Republican-led investigations in the House and Senate. Doing so, according to Sen. Angus King, would lead to some major logistical headaches — and could cause it to take even longer for the public to get answers. “The problem with creating an independent commission is, who gets to appoint the members?” said King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. “They don't have security clearances. That would have to take time. In other words, it would be about six to eight months to get where we are now in the Intelligence Committee.” Martin Matishak contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t Following the 2016 US Presidential election, Facebook has faced persistent scrutiny from users and lawmakers over how it handles politics.The most recent controversy involves Facebook's decision not to fact-check political ads, which it considers \"political speech.\" Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, have argued that the policy keeps Facebook from becoming the \"arbiter of truth.\"But in an interview with Sandberg on the Byers Market podcast published on Thursday, she argued that — even if Facebook wanted to — it would be impossible to fact-check political ads. \"If you look at political ads and fact-checking political ads, that's really not something anyone is capable of doing,\" she said.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n",

And if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.\"The position has proven controversial enough that Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg have spent the last several months repeatedly defending it in interviews.In Sandberg's latest interview, with NBC News' Byers Market podcast, she makes a new argument: Facebook is incapable of fact-checking political ads.\n",

            "Sandberg acknowledges that \"there's no perfect answer here,\" and that Facebook is still evolving on the subject.In the past, both Sandberg and Zuckerberg have argued two main points: Political advertising is equivalent to political speech, and therefore must be presented without censorship, and Facebook makes very little money from said advertising.\"We're not doing it because of the money,\" Sandberg said in an October 2019 interview with Bloomberg. \"This is less than 1% of our revenue and the revenue is not worth the controversy.\"Zuckerberg made a similar argument during an investor earnings call last year.\"In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,\" he said. \"And although I've considered whether we should not carry these ads in the past, and I'll continue to do so, on balance so far I've thought we should continue.

Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn't protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts publicly backed the letter and the employees who wrote it.\"Facebook's own employees know just how dangerous their policy allowing politicians to lie in political ads will be for our democracy,\" Warren wrote. \"Mark Zuckerberg should listen to them — and I applaud their brave efforts to hold their own company accountable.\"\n",

            "Zuckerberg highlighted as much during his speech at Georgetown.\"Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it's not clear where we'd draw the line,\" he said. \"There are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women's empowerment? If we banned candidates' ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves?\"It's a reasonable point — if Facebook were to ban \"political\" ads, it would have to spend a lot of time defining what is and isn't political speech. And then it would come under fire for policing free speech.\"There are issues any way you cut this,\" Zuckerberg said, \"and when it's not absolutely clear what to do, I believe we should err on the side of greater expression.\"\n",

            "\t President Trump is right that the U.S. risks being left behind on 5G, Huawei's rotating chairman said on Sunday in Barcelona. Speaking at a roundtable with media on Sunday at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Guo Ping said he had noticed President Trump's tweets saying the U.S. should adopt 5G \"as fast as possible\" and the U.S. should not \"block out\" more advanced technologies \"I think his message is clear and correct,\" Guo said. While Trump's tweets did not directly single out Huawei, it's likely he was referring to the company as U.S. officials weigh an executive order banning Huawei's 5G telecommunciations equipment. Huawei has been effectively left out of the U.S. market due to fears its technology will enable Chinese spying, a concern the company dismisses. Other nations including Germany, the U.K. and New Zealand are also weighing bans on Huawei's 5G technology. On Sunday Guo said an executive order against Huawei \"is not necessary and should not be released.\" He added the ban would hurt small telecom companies in the U.S. that rely on Huawei's equipment, which is often cheaper than its' rivals technology. Guo said Huawei has faced cybersecurity challenges, led by \"one major power,\" though he did not explicitly name the U.S. But he added the company does not need the U.S. market to be successful. Huawei is the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment. Guo said the company is 12 months ahead of its rivals in implementing 5G technology. He further added 5G standards should be deteremined by technical experts, not politicians. \"This should not be something that's decided by the politics,\" he said.\n",

            "\t Welcome to Hillicon Valley, The Hill's newsletter detailing all you need to know about the tech and cyber news from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. If you don't already, be sure to sign up for our newsletter with this LINK. Welcome! Follow the cyber team, Maggie Miller (@magmill95), and the tech team, Emily Birnbaum (@birnbaum_e) and Chris Mills Rodrigo (@chrisismills).   WAY OUT FROM HUAWEI: Lawmakers on Wednesday heard from executives at top telecommunications companies as the Senate Commerce Committee weighed measures to prevent Chinese giant Huawei from getting a foothold in the emerging U.S. 5G network. The hearing on \"5G supply chain security\" featured executives from companies including Nokia and Ericsson, who touted their technology as a viable and secure alternative and offered their support for legislation to help American telecom providers replace Huawei equipment. Washington has grappled with the question of how to exclude Huawei, the largest provider of 5G equipment worldwide, as the U.S. begins a massive rollout of 5G. Concerns largely stem from a 2017 Chinese intelligence law that requires Chinese companies and citizens to assist in state intelligence work if requested.    5G executives weigh in: European firms Nokia and Ericsson are often cited as the largest competitors for manufacturing 5G equipment. Jason Boswell, the head of security for Ericsson's Network Product Solutions, testified that Ericsson saw their products as \"the best in the world.\" He argued that should the U.S. decide to rely on Ericsson for 5G equipment, the company saw no \"restrictions on our ability to meet manufacturing demand.\" Michael Murphy, the chief technology officer for Nokia in the Americas region, noted that while Huawei was a \"formidable opponent\" due to the heavy investment by Chinese banks into the company and its market share, he did \"not feel we are at a technical disadvantage to being able to keep on par with Huawei.\"   On Capitol Hill: Concern around Huawei on Capitol Hill has been a rare area of bipartisan agreement in recent months, and the Trump administration made convincing allied nations to ban the company from their networks a key priority. But finding a replacement for Huawei's products has been a challenge for Washington. Both Boswell and Murphy also on Wednesday threw their weight behind the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Act, which the House passed in December and which passed unanimously in the Senate last week. It would ban the use of federal funds to buy telecom equipment from companies deemed a national security threat, such as Huawei or Chinese firm ZTE. The bill would also create a $1 billion program to assist small telecom providers, mostly in rural areas in the U.S., who depend heavily on Huawei equipment, giving them funding to rip out the equipment posing a threat and replace it with equipment from \"trusted providers.\" Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger WickerRoger Frederick WickerHillicon Valley: Lawmakers seek 5G rivals to Huawei | Amazon, eBay grilled over online counterfeits | Judge tosses Gabbard lawsuit against Google | GOP senator introduces bill banning TikTok on government devices Lawmakers look for 5G competitors to Huawei Hillicon Valley — Presented by Facebook — Federal court rules tech giants can censor content | Trump upends surveillance fight | Senate passes bill barring federal funds for Huawei equipment  MORE (R-Miss.) during the hearing said he expected President TrumpDonald John TrumpAs Biden surges, GOP Ukraine probe moves to the forefront Republicans, rooting for Sanders, see Biden wins as setback Trump says Biden Ukraine dealings will be a 'major' campaign issue MORE to soon sign the bill, putting a major dent in Huawei's business. \"It was a statement by the House and the Senate as a whole on a bipartisan basis, and I expect the president will be signing that legislation with some fanfare in the next few days,\" Wicker said.    Huawei fires back: Huawei on Wednesday pushed back against Nokia and Ericsson's claims.  Huawei USA Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy told The Hill following the hearing that \"there is really only one telecom equipment supplier for 5G around the world, and that is Huawei,\" adding that Nokia's and Ericsson's claims of industry dominance \"don't have a basis in facts.\" \"Why doesn't the community organize public bake-offs, competitions between the technologies?\" Purdy said. \"I encourage that kind of competition.\" Purdy said Huawei was \"really concerned\" for its telecom customers in the U.S. if Trump signs the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Act, which he said was \"forcing pain\" on those companies. \"It is going to take more time and cost more time and money than the elected officials recognize,\" Purdy said.  Don Morrissey, Huawei's director of congressional affairs, told The Hill that while Huawei was not invited to testify at Wednesday's hearing, they \"would like to have been.\" Morrissey noted that the company was reaching out to committee members to argue their side in a \"methodical way.\" Read more here.   LAWMAKERS SAY KEEP CALM AND BAN HUAWEI: A bipartisan group of senators led by Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump slams Schumer statement on Kavanaugh, Gorsuch: 'Serious action MUST be taken NOW' Montana's Democratic governor plans last-minute run for Senate Schumer's office says he was referencing justices paying 'political price' MORE (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday \"strongly urged\" the British Parliament to reject Chinese telecom group Huawei and exclude it entirely from their 5G networks.

Executives with eBay and Amazon, two of the top U.S. e-commerce players, testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce about how they're working to sweep up fake and potentially dangerous products before they're sold to their millions of customers. The company representatives emphasized they are willing to work with the government as they step up their various internal efforts. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers questioned whether the platforms are benefiting from legal loopholes and skirting liability as their customers are duped and injured by fake iPhone chargers, children's products and electronics.     Why lawmakers are worried: \"The emergence of these unregulated platforms has given criminal enterprises additional means to sell stolen and counterfeit goods to unsuspecting consumers,\" said Rep.

The majority of fake and imitation products seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection over the past two decades arrived from China and Hong Kong, according to U.S. government data, and the latest trade agreement with China requires Beijing to take stronger action against counterfeit goods. \"The president has made this a priority,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.), the top Republican on the subcommittee, \"which is clear in 'Phase 1' of the U.S.-China Trade deal.\"  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) quickly took issue with McMorris-Rodgers's suggestion, saying before his opening remarks, \"You said the Trump administration's leading on this issue -- I don't think they are.\"   White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in particular has led the administration's efforts on the issue.

Judge Stephen Wilson, a Reagan appointee, shot down Gabbard's key arguments, most prominently affirming that Google is not the government and therefore can't be held liable for violating her First Amendment rights. The Gabbard campaign's \"essential allegation is that Google violated [her campaign's] First Amendment rights by temporarily suspending its verified political advertising account for several hours shortly after a Democratic primary debate,\" Wilson wrote in a filing on Tuesday.  He added that her claim \"runs headfirst into two insurmountable barriers -- the First Amendment and Supreme Court precedent,\" quoting a recent decision that affirmed Google is legally allowed to censor any content on its services, including YouTube. Gabbard, the long-shot presidential candidate known for bucking her own party, sued Google in July in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleging the tech behemoth censored her presidential campaign when it suspended the advertising account for several hours after a Democratic debate. Google refuted her claims, chalking up the brief suspension to a technical malfunction.  Gabbard's lawsuit marked the first time a presidential contender has sued a large technology company over such claims.  Read more here.   BAD NEWS FOR TIKTOK: Sen.

The legislation comes as several agencies that deal with national security and intelligence issues have completely banned their employees from using TikTok, a social media platform owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance. However, enforcement of those bans has been spotty, with many military members, for example, still posting on TikTok. The short form video platform has exploded in popularity in the U.S., having been downloaded more than 123 million times in the country, but has been met with increasing scrutiny. Lawmakers and intelligence officials have warned that Chinese law requiring companies to hand over data in investigations means that apps from the company pose a threat to American data security.

Paul Nakasone told a House panel Wednesday that election security is his \"top priority,\" emphasizing strides made in combating threats in the years since Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \"We are 244 days from the 2020 presidential election,\" Nakasone testified during a House Armed Services subcommittee hearing on U.S. Cyber Command's proposed fiscal 2021 budget. \"My top priority is a safe and secure election that is free from foreign influence.\" Nakasone emphasized that even if foreign actors try to interfere in U.S. elections, federal agencies are prepared. \"Malicious actors are trying to test our defenses and our resolve,\" Nakasone warned. \"We are ready for them, and any others, who try to interfere in our democratic processes.\" U.S. Cyber Command, which is a branch of the Department of Defense, was involved in monitoring for cyber interference during both the 2018 midterm elections and on Super Tuesday this week. Nakasone said the rate of improvement made by U.S. Cyber Command and other federal agencies in communicating threats to elections made the work done on Election Day in 2018 \"look like a pickup game to me as opposed to what I saw yesterday.\" Read more here.   EVERYTHING IS FINE: A senior official at the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cyber agency said Tuesday night that they had not seen any \"malicious cyber activity\" aimed at disrupting elections during primary voting in 14 states. \"We don't have any reports of any malicious cyber activity across the states today,\" the senior official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) told reporters.  The official noted that while there were some \"sporadic\" information technology (IT) issues, all the election systems were able to get \"back up and running\" with no issues due to targeting by hackers. One IT incident the official pointed to was in California, where the secretary of state's website was briefly brought down by what the office tweeted was \"higher than normal traffic\" and not hacking activity. CISA ran a national cybersecurity awareness room on Election Day to track threats to elections and coordinate information sharing officials at all levels of government. Coming out of this experience, the official said there were \"more opportunities to learn and continue to improve\" on election security coordination ahead of the November elections.

Google cited advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) as the reason for their cancellation. They become the latest group to cancel major conferences in light of the outbreak. This week Facebook announced that they would be pulling out of panels they were set to participate in at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. Amnesty International announced on Monday that they would also be canceling their annual meeting in San Diego.

I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action,” Sessions said in a direct response to Trump's interview. “However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.\" Gonzales said on Sunday that he thought it was appropriate for Sessions to respond to Trump's remarks. \"It's important for the attorney general to reassure the American people, and speaking to the American president, that he is in control of the Department of Justice and that it is operating the way that it should be operating,\" he said. \"As president of the United States, [Trump] has a right to be critical, to say what he wants to say about his Cabinet officials,\" he continued. \"As a general manner, I think it's more effective to do it privately than publicly because it undermines the department, the attorney general, and also hurts the morale of the Department of Justice.\" Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Sessions and the Justice Department over special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, which he has dubbed a political “witch hunt.”  View the discussion thread.

            "\t (Adds paragraphs on shorter-dated bills, updates yields) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries rallied on Wednesday, taking the benchmark 10-year yield to a 14-month low, after the Federal Reserve said it would hold interest rates steady and its policymakers abandoned projections for further rate hikes this year while flagging an expected economic slowdown. In a major shift in its perspective, the U.S. central bank also expects to raise borrowing costs only once more through 2021, and no longer anticipates the need to guard against inflation with restrictive monetary policy. The two-year Treasury yield, which is a proxy for investor sentiment about interest-rate hikes, logged its largest daily drop since Jan. 3 and was last at 2.402 percent. The benchmark 10-year yield, which reflects investor sentiment about the overall health of the economy, fell by as much as 8 basis points to the lowest since January 2018 and was last at 2.539 percent. The change in the Treasury market was significant enough that yields on two-, three-, five- and seven-year notes were below that of short-dated three-month bills, which last returned 2.464 percent. The U.S. bond market’s gauges on investors’ inflation views also turned higher on Wednesday. The yield spread between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasuries was 1.971 percent, which was near its highest level since early December. This was nearly 2 basis points higher from late on Tuesday, Tradeweb data showed. The Fed also said it would slow the monthly reduction of its Treasury bond holdings from up to $30 billion to up to $15 billion beginning in May. It said it would end its balance sheet runoff in September provided the economy and money market conditions evolved as expected. “(The statement) definitely skewed on the dovish side of expectations. The main surprise is that the Fed projects zero hikes in 2019. Whereas our broad expectation, and the expectation of consensus, was for them to leave in at least one hike in 2019,” said Evan Brown, head of macro asset allocation strategy at UBS Asset Management. “There’s one hike projected for 2020 but there’s a long time between now and then and so the market is effectively taking the view that the Fed is done tightening.” In January, the Fed pivoted after hiking rates four times in 2018, pledging patience before making further moves. In February, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said the central bank would stop shrinking its balance sheet later this year. (Reporting by Kate Duguid; Editing by Richard Chang and Diane Craft)\n",

            "\t * U.S. consumer spending rises in April * Chicago PMI and U.S. consumer confidence fall, but yields hold gains By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt yields rose across the board on Tuesday, with that of short-dated notes rising to their highest in more than two months, after upbeat consumer spending data reinforced expectations of interest rate hikes in the next few months. Yields on U.S. two-year notes, which tend to be sensitive to the outlook for interest rates, rose to 0.938 percent, their strongest level since mid-March. The long-end of the curve also advanced, with yields on benchmark 10-year notes advancing to a one-month peak. U.S. Treasury yields had been on an uptrend since Friday when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said gradual U.S. interest rate increases would be appropriate if the economy improves further and the labor market tightens. “Market pricing for upcoming rate hikes is certainly being supported by the stronger April personal income and spending numbers this morning,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York. “If the Fed is really data-dependent and looking at growth momentum, these numbers would do very well for GDP (gross domestic product) tracking and that’s helping push yields higher.” Data showed on Tuesday that U.S. consumer spending in April posted its biggest increase in more than six years, while inflation rose steadily. U.S. Midwest business activity as measured by the Chicago PMI contracted in April, but this report has been highly erratic this year. Meanwhile, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence data showed the main index weakened in May, but there were positive aspects such as a rise in the U.S. jobs index and an increase in inflation expectations. Overall, the weaker-than-expected headline numbers for both the Chicago PMI and U.S. consumer confidence data hardly made a dent on yields. In mid-morning trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down 12/32 in price for a yield of 1.879 percent, from 1.854 percent last Friday. U.S. 10-year yields rose as high as 1.89 percent, their highest since late April. Two-year notes were down 2/32 in price, with a yield of 0.922 percent, compared with 0.915 percent late on Friday. U.S. five-year notes, meanwhile, fell 7/32, yielding 1.405 percent, up from 1.391 percent on Friday. Fed funds futures, based on the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, moved to price in a 26 percent chance of a June rate hike on Tuesday, up from 19 percent more than a week ago.

In a letter to the DNC, Sanders argues the fundraising raises \"serious apparent violations\" of the campaign finance laws, and that they should \"cease immediately.\" The letter was sent by Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders' campaign, to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. The letter said the Hillary Victory Fund reported receiving individual contributions as high at $353,400 or more, \"which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton's campaign.\" \"Bernie 2016 is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising, both of which appear to benefit only HFA by generating low dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees,\" the letter says. Deutsch said in the letter that the issue has \"grown to staggering magnitudes\" and \"can no longer be ignored.\" \"Bernie 2016 is concerned that, at best, the joint fundraising committee's spending on direct mail and online advertising appears to represent an impermissible in-kind contribution from the DNC and the participating state party committees to HFA,\" the letter said. “At worst, using funds received from large-dollar donors who have already contributed the $2,700 maximum to HFA [Hillary for America] may represent an excessive contribution to HFA from these individuals.” It also says that the joint committee paid the Clinton campaign committee $2.6 million to \"reimburse\" members of Clinton's presidential campaign for time running the joint committee. Deutsch said this “raises equally serious concerns that joint committee funds, which are meant to be allocated proportionally among the participating committees, are being used to impermissibly subsidize HFA through an over-reimbursement for campaign staffers and resources.”“While the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time — it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, in a news release.

But were pollsters actually mistaken in 2016?

It was political data analysis sites that got people thinking that Trump had no chance. \"That's wrong,\" Miringoff said in panel discussion featured on \"What America's Thinking,\" Hill.TV's new show about public opinion, when asked about the common perception that pollsters messed up in 2016. \"I think there was a whole bunch of other stuff going on, but there were also these forecasters who really took hold. FiveThirtyEight, YouGov, HuffPost — they were the ones who were 'modeling' things. They were taking some polls, putting it in their special sauce,\" Miringoff told host Joe Concha in reference to several sites that featured probability analyses based upon aggregated polling data. All of the major political data publications pegged Clinton's chances of victory at greater than 70 percent. FiveThirtyEight, which is now owned by ABC News, gave Trump the highest probability, 29 percent, a decision that some left-leaning political observers criticized. \"If you tell someone they've got a 71 percent chance of winning, people think that that's going to happen,\" Miringoff continued. \"If you say it's going to be a 71 percent chance that it's going to rain, and you bring an umbrella and it doesn't rain, you don't care so much. But with the presidency of the United States, it makes a whole big difference.\" Ultimately, Miringoff added, it was not polling operations that called the 2016 election incorrectly. \"The models got it wrong, the polls did not have a bad day.\" The Marist Poll’s final survey estimated Clinton's margin of victory at 2 percent. The final RealClearPolitics average of national surveys before the election indicated the Democrat would win the popular vote by 3 percentage points. In the officially certified tally, Clinton received 2.1 percent more votes nationwide than Trump. Later in his remarks, Miringoff urged political observers not to become fixated on a single way of thinking about an upcoming contest, particularly the upcoming congressional elections this year. \"We can't get stuck on a fixed narrative,\" the pollster said. \"Hillary Clinton's going to win, Hillary Clinton's going to win, Hillary Clinton's going to win. Oh, she didn't win. Right now it's blue wave, blue wave, blue wave.\" Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight's founder, has defended the practice of assigning percentages to candidates' chances. In a post-election column, he also defended pollsters. \"We strongly disagree with the idea that there was a massive polling error,\" he wrote. \"Instead, there was a modest polling error, well in line with historical polling errors, but even a modest error was enough to provide for plenty of paths to victory for Trump. We think people should have been better prepared for it.\" —Matthew Sheffield An overwhelming majority of voters are concerned that the U.S. will enter a recession in 2020, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released Monday. A majority of Republican voters -- 62 percent -- identify as both fiscally and socially conservative, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll released on Friday. More than half of voters would not consider reelecting President Trump in 2020, according to a new poll released on Thursday. Top-tier candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Two-thirds of voters said in a poll released Tuesday that President Trump’s next round of China tariffs will increase prices on U.S. consumer goods. Mental illness, weak gun laws and hateful public rhetoric are largely to blame for mass shootings in the United States, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Just over half of Republicans — 51 percent — said in a new Hill-HarrisX poll that the federal deficit is a problem that the government needs to deal with immediately.  Less than half of U.S. voters trust companies headquartered in Mexico and China, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. President Trump’s job approval rating has dropped six points among voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in the latest Hill-HarrisX poll. A plurality of voters — 44 percent — say they think President Trump responds more fiercely to critics who aren’t white, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Tuesday. Almost half of voters polled — 47 percent — say there was no clear winner from last week’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Twenty-seven percent of Americans said that they thought the latest two-year budget deal would have no impact on their financial situation, according to a new poll out Friday. Support for impeachment proceedings against President Trump has slipped among Democratic voters following special counsel Robert Mueller’s public testimony before Congress last week, according to a poll released on Thursday.

            "\t Newly released documents from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation link the Russia probe and the current impeachment inquiry into the president, the Washington Post reports. What's new: Digital news platform BuzzFeed successfully sued for the documents. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort suggested in 2016 that Ukraine could have been responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee instead of Russia, the newly released internal memos show.  The backdrop: In their July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say Crowdstrike...\" The whistleblower accused Trump, in that call, of trying to \"pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president's 2020 reelection bid\"  by investigating Joe and Hunter Biden in exchange for military aid.  In the call, which is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, the president appeared to subscribe to a right-wing conspiracy theory that Crowdstrike, the U.S.-owned firm hired by the DNC to investigate hackers responsible for the 2016 breach, is owned by Ukraine. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney walked back his comments in October about the Trump administration freezing military aid as leverage to get Ukraine to investigate that conspiracy theory. What else: According to the new memos, former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates told the FBI he believed the president and others may have known ahead of time about WikiLeaks’ plans to release DNC emails allegedly stolen by Russia, per the Post.

            "\t MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian officials will not testify in the U.S. Congress in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump because Kiev does not want to get involved in the internal affairs of another country, Ukraine’s foreign minister said on Tuesday. “We don’t have anything to do with this at all,” Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference in the port city of Mariupol. “We won’t go there, we won’t comment.” Democrats are investigating whether there are grounds to impeach Trump over his request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, has testified that Trump made the release of U.S. security aid to Ukraine contingent on Kiev publicly declaring it would carry out investigations that Trump sought. Trump has called the inquiry a “witch hunt”. He has said there was no quid pro quo related to the $391 million to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed forces in the eastern Donbass region. Prystaiko said relations between Kiev and Washington had not changed since the start of the impeachment row and that it was normal for the two countries to use formal and informal channels to conduct diplomacy. “There are channels that are specially separated from the official ones, but this does not mean that the official ones don’t know what is happening,” he said. He also said Ukraine needed to receive official requests from the United States in order to open investigations. Asked whether Ukraine had received such a request to investigate Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Biden’s son Hunter used to be a board member, he said that question should go to the General Prosecutor’s office. Taylor was at the same conference in Mariupol but declined to speak to the media about the impeachment inquiry. Writing by Matthias Williams, Editing by Timothy Heritage\n",

            "\t WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director who was fired late Friday, kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with President Trump and his conversations with the former director James B. Comey, a person close to Mr. McCabe said on Saturday. The memos could bolster the account of Mr. Comey, whose own memos and testimony describe repeated requests by Mr. Trump to clear his name. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to shut down a criminal investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Both matters are under investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is considering whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. McCabe’s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller’s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey’s account. Mr. Trump has denied pressuring Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation. Mr. Comey was fired last spring, and the revelation of his conversations with Mr. Trump helped lead to the special counsel’s appointment. Mr. McCabe is known to have had at least three meetings with the president. In one, he asked Mr. McCabe how he had voted in the presidential election. In each, he asked about Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, who ran a failed campaign as a Democrat for the Virginia State Senate. Mr. McCabe has identified as a lifelong Republican but did not vote in the 2016 presidential race. The existence of his memos was first reported by The Associated Press. Mr. McCabe was fired less than two days before his retirement. Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited what he said was a lack of candor by Mr. McCabe in interviews with internal investigators. His firing had been recommended by career disciplinary officials at the F.B.I. Mr. McCabe immediately declared that his firing was part of a Trump administration effort to discredit him and damage the special counsel’s investigation. In an interview, he said he had not made false statements. “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness,” he said. He was among the first F.B.I. officials to scrutinize possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies of the president have cast Mr. McCabe as the center of a “deep state” effort to undermine the Trump presidency. His lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, said Justice Department officials had rushed to fire Mr. McCabe before he could qualify for his pension. “This distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president’s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe,” Mr. Bromwich said late Friday. Mr. Trump kept up his Twitter barrage on Saturday, pointing to hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Ms. McCabe’s campaign from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and a longtime ally of the Clintons. The president’s personal lawyer seemed to lend credence Saturday to the idea that Mr. McCabe and Mr. Mueller were linked in the eyes of the president. Asked by The Daily Beast for a response to Mr. McCabe’s firing, the lawyer, John Dowd, sent an email saying it was now time that the special counsel investigation be shut down.\n",

            "\t Robert Mueller’s nearly two-year Russia probe concluded without finding adequate evidence to show that officials with Donald Trump’s presidential 2016 campaign aided Russian attempts to interfere with the election. “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” the special counsel wrote in his findings, which Attorney General William Barr released on Sunday in four-page summary form. Mueller’s long-awaited findings also do not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, a gray-area conclusion that leaves the door wide open for an already-heated debate in Congress over whether Democrats should even consider impeachment proceedings against the president. “For each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leave unresolved what the special counsel views as ‘difficult issues’ of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction,” Barr wrote in a letter to the key House and Senate committees. “The Special Counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,’” Barr added. However, in an apparent departure from the four corners of Mueller’s report, Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” Notwithstanding that nuance and Mueller’s decision not to assess whether the president committed obstruction, Trump was unreserved in declaring victory on Sunday. “No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!” he wrote on Twitter. The decision by Barr and Rosenstein to publicly put a Trump-vindicating gloss on Mueller’s report was quickly capitalized on by the White House, which drew no distinction between Mueller’s findings and those of Barr and Rosenstein. “The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “AG Barr and DAG Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction. The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States.” That point is certain to unleash a firestorm of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and other Trump critics who appear eager to enter a protracted legal fight to lift the curtain further on the special counsel’s investigation. Nonetheless, Mueller’s conclusions on Russian meddling as summarized by Barr represent a big victory for Trump, whose White House over the past two years has been consumed by questions about whether it won the last presidential election with help from a foreign power. During the 2016 campaign, Trump publicly called on Russia to try to find missing emails of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. However, Mueller’s report apparently excluded that sort of exhortation, limiting its definition of coordination to a “tacit or express” agreement between the campaign and the Russian government. Barr’s summary of the special counsel's investigation describes a probe launched in May 2017 that leaned on more than 2,800 subpoenas, the execution of nearly 500 search warrants, 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence and interviews with about 500 witnesses. But apart from the already known indictments against a series of Trump officials, including his former campaign chairman, personal lawyer and national security adviser, Barr said there were no additional indictments from Mueller to be made public and no charges under seal. Trump, his lawyers and other aides have projected an air of calm while they waited for the release of the findings, which they got word of officially at 3 p.m. Sunday, when Barr’s chief of staff, Brian Rabbitt, called Emmet Flood, the top White House attorney handling Russia matters, and gave him a summary of the letter that was going to Capitol Hill.  “That’s the extent of the contact between us and the White House on the report thus far,” a Justice Department official told reporters. The attorney general and Rosenstein did not consult or coordinate with Mueller about the letter released Friday, a Justice Department official said. Asked whether there was any disagreement between Barr and Rosenstein over the conclusions made public Sunday, the official said: “The deputy attorney general and attorney general have worked hand-in-hand on this.” With Democrats on alert for any sign of White House influence over the process, Justice officials insisted they were being careful to observe appropriate protocols. Barr and Rosenstein said their conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice was not based on longstanding Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. However, the top Justice Department officials and Trump appointees said their assessment was influenced by Mueller’s finding that the evidence did not establish that Trump actually committed a crime relating to Russia’s election interference. If he didn’t, he probably wasn’t mounting a cover-up, Barr and Rosenstein said. “While not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction,” Barr wrote. Barr’s summary does not address myriad subplots that have long lingered over the Mueller inquiry, including everything from the so-called Steele dossier — a collection of raw intelligence memos compiled by a former British spy that described a years-long Russian plot to cultivate Trump and propel him to the White House — to the now infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 involving a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and several top Trump campaign officials.  That meeting, originally offered on the premise that the Russian government could provide “dirt” on Clinton, has long been seen as an example of the Trump campaign’s eagerness to benefit politically from stolen Democratic emails. But Barr’s summary does give a nod to the two previously unveiled Mueller indictments that dig in on the Kremlin’s election meddling effort, the first against an alleged “troll farm” housed in Russia’s Internet Research Agency that filled social media platforms during the 2016 campaign with posts slamming Clinton and backing Trump, and the second involving charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Despite those cases, Barr nonetheless noted that Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” A Justice Department official said Sunday that the process of preparing a fuller version of the Mueller investigation for public release is already underway, but refused to predict how long it would take. Officials have also declined to say how long Mueller’s submission to the Justice Department was, beyond describing it as “comprehensive.” Sunday’s summary hardly resolves all of the questions looming over the president, his White House and the Justice Department. Indeed, another big question Barr faces is just how much information to make public from Mueller’s investigation on topics where the special counsel didn’t move to file an indictment. With a few exceptions, Justice Department policy has historically been to not air people’s dirty laundry if an investigation didn’t lead to charges. Barr said in his letter Sunday that his review of Mueller’s report before a more comprehensive forthcoming release would have to take into account the ancillary investigations spawned by Mueller’s investigation. “I … must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices,” the attorney general wrote. Barr’s letter Sunday also warns about the process of making more information public that will be limited by the presence of information Mueller obtained through grand juries. Such testimony and evidence are traditionally kept secret by law, although there are some exceptions to that rule. “Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to grand jury secrecy requirements,” Barr wrote, adding that at least some of it “by law cannot be made public.” While grand jury secrecy does limit the Justice Department’s discretion to release some information, judges sometimes approve such releases, including a disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee when it was preparing articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon over Watergate. Democrats in today’s Congress — including Rep. Jerrold Nadler, current head of the powerful House Judiciary Committee — continued to demand access to Mueller’s full report and the underlying evidence, warning that the legislative branch’s constitutional oversight abilities could be impaired if the Justice Department does not release incriminating materials about the president. “It’s equivalent to a cover-up,” Nadler, a New York Democrat, said on “Fox News Sunday” prior to the release of Barr’s summary. Turning to Twitter after the attorney general sent the summary to Congress, Nadler detailed plans for his next step.  “In light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report, where Mueller did not exonerate the President, we will be calling Attorney General Barr in to testify before @HouseJudiciary in the near future,” he wrote. Mueller’s investigation, now finished, isn’t the only game in town for Trump. Federal prosecutors in New York are examining the president’s inauguration and campaign spending. States have active inquiries into Trump’s real estate projects as well as his personal finances. The summary document that Barr released Sunday left lawmakers with little in the way of a road map as they do their own homework on the question of impeachment. For the special counsel, impeachment was never something directly on his agenda. It’s an absence that is actually by design and stems from Ken Starr’s five-year tenure investigating President Bill Clinton on a range of controversial matters, including the Democrat’s extramarital affair with a White House intern. Lawmakers exhausted by Starr’s efforts, which culminated in an unsuccessful and bitterly partisan impeachment effort on Capitol Hill, allowed the post-Watergate law to lapse that authorized those kinds of wide-ranging probe. In its place, the Clinton Justice Department wrote new rules governing future executive branch investigations but dropped the requirement that Starr faced to report any potential impeachable offenses to Congress. Mueller’s investigators have been working under those same Clinton-era rules and faced no explicit mandate to tell Congress about any possible Trump crimes they found. Essentially, for all the work the special counsel just did to examine the president for possible obstruction of justice, experts say the onus is on lawmakers to decide whether they want to build their own record to try to remove Trump. “If the House wants to consider impeachment, it needs to do its own work,” Starr wrote in an Atlantic op-ed published Friday. “It would be odd in the extreme to ask, in effect, the executive branch to become a tool of the legislative branch in a death-struggle with the only individual identified in the Constitution as the possessor and wielder of executive power: the president,” Starr added. “That was the old way, under the old statute. Congress did away with that approach, and wisely so.” Faced with such limits, House Democrats are struggling with their own next steps. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wouldn’t allow impeachment proceedings to begin unless one or more true smoking guns emerged that rose to the level of the Constitution’s loosely defined “high crimes and misdemeanors” requirement. She also wants to see significant numbers of Republicans show an interest in backing such an effort; otherwise, the California Democrat said, an attempt to remove Trump is “just not worth it.” Meanwhile, her Democratic committee leaders have started building a record in case impeachment is a necessary option. Nadler is working through the thousands of pages of documents from Trump aides and associates that arrived after an initial batch of 81 letters went out earlier this month that seek to duplicate the record Mueller has. Nadler and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), have also said they’ll try to subpoena the bulk of Mueller’s investigative work. Both Democrats have also said they are ready to call Mueller to Capitol Hill to deliver both private and public testimony, though people who know the soon-to-be-former special counsel are skeptical he’d divert from a script approved by the Justice Department and divulge details beyond what’s been released to Congress. Lawmakers may lack in seeing specific mentions of Trump in a Mueller report, but that doesn’t mean the president can slip completely under the radar. In New York, prosecutors who secured a guilty plea from Michael Cohen said that Trump directed his longtime personal lawyer to make payments to two women to keep them silent about alleged extramarital affairs. “You can call someone ‘Individual 1’ all you want,” said James Trusty, a former federal prosecutor and friend of Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. “You don’t have to be a Navajo code talker to decipher who that is.” While Trump’s hostility toward Mueller’s investigation has been unmistakable, he has sent mixed messages about the report. Weeks ago, the president said he looked forward to seeing it. He also gave House Republicans a green light to join what would end up being a 420-0 vote for the report’s release. However, in remarks and an interview last week, the president suggested that the special counsel should have never been in position to prepare it. “Now, somebody is going to write a report who never got a vote,” Trump complained to reporters Wednesday.\n",

            "\t * Premium for cash over 3-month tin still elevated * Tin stocks about one-third of December levels (Updates with official prices) By Pratima Desai LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Monday as worries about demand in top consumer China were reinforced after data showed weaker economic growth and on expectations of slowing activity ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was untraded in official rings, but bid down 1.1 percent to $5,983 a tonne. Prices of the metal used widely in power and construction touched a 3-week high of $6,077 a tonne last week. “Everything comes to a halt in the run up to and during the Chinese New Year break, that softens the market,” said Macquarie analyst Vivienne Lloyd. “Damage to copper prices from the trade has been priced in, so any sort of rapprochement would be bullish.” GROWTH: China’s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, dragging 2018 growth to 6.6 percent, the lowest in nearly three decades. With support measures expected to take time to kick in, many believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better, and see a further slowing to 6.3 percent this year. HEALTH: “China remains an important determinant of how healthy the copper market is. While the government has extended fiscal and monetary stimulus, the support has so far been cautious,” BofAML analysts said in a note. “In our view this is unlikely to change for various reasons. Most notably, rebalancing the economy towards services/ knowledge-intensive sectors makes many of the traditional stimulus tools less effective.” HOLIDAY: The Lunar New Year break runs from Feb. 4-8, but many factories close the week before. TRADE: The United States is pushing for regular reviews of China’s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal - and could again resort to tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement. TECHNICALS: Support for copper stands around $5,950 a tonne, the 21-day moving average. Resistance is at $6,080 where the 55-day moving average currently sits. TIN: Concern about nearby supplies of tin on the LME market have created a large premium above $100 a tonne for the cash over the 3-month CMSN0-3 contract. STOCKS: Tin stocks in LME approved warehouses at 1,090 tonnes are about a third of the level in December and large holdings of tin warrants and cash contracts are behind the nervousness. MSNSTX-TOTAL Three-month tin was up 0.1 percent at $20,625 a tonne, close to the 7-month high of $20,770 a tonne hit last week. PRICES: Aluminium CMAL0-3 fell 0.8 percent to $1,855 a tonne, zinc slipped 0.6 percent to $2,565, lead rose 0.5 percent to $2,008 and nickel slipped 0.1 percent to $11,750 a tonne.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% by 0808 GMT, with its exporter stocks also taking a hit from gains in sterling ahead of UK general election later this week. The FTSE 250 also dipped 0.2%, with Tullow Oil single-handedly accounting for all of the index’s fall in early deals after the oil and gas explorer scrapped dividend and said its CEO was stepping down. The stock touched its lowest in more than 15 years. Data showing China’s exports in November shrank for the fourth consecutive month fanned worries over Sino-U.S. trade war’s impact on the world’s second-largest economy.

            "\t A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily blocked President Trump’s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide, reopening America’s door to visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries and dealing the administration a humbling defeat. The White House vowed late Friday to fight what it called an “outrageous” ruling, saying it would seek an emergency halt to the judge’s order as soon as possible and restore the president’s “lawful and appropriate order.” “The president’s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,” the White House said. A revised statement released later omitted the word “outrageous.” And early Saturday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted in defense of his stand. Courts around the country have halted aspects of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on travel from the seven countries, but the Seattle ruling was the most far-reaching to date. Airlines that had been stopping travelers from boarding planes to the United States were told by the government in a conference call Friday night to begin allowing them to fly, according to a person familiar with the call but who declined to be identified because it was a private discussion. The Trump administration, however, could again block the travelers if it were to win an emergency stay. The federal government was “arguing that we have to protect the U.S. from individuals from these countries, and there’s no support for that,” said the judge, James Robart of Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington, an appointee of President George W. Bush, in a decision delivered from the bench. The judge’s ruling was temporary, putting Mr. Trump’s policy on hold at least until the government and opponents of the order had a chance to make full arguments, or until the administration won a stay. “What we’re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the A.C.L.U. “There’s obviously more litigation to come, but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban.” It is not unusual for district courts to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions, and the federal government must obey such injunctions even when other district courts have declined to issue injunctions in similar cases. Judge Robart temporarily barred the administration from enforcing two parts of Mr. Trump’s order: its 90-day suspension of entry into the United States of people from the seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — and its limits on accepting refugees, including “any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities.” The order had suspended admissions of any refugees for 120 days, and of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The goal, the president said, was to evaluate the process for vetting refugees and other immigrants in order to safeguard the country against terrorism. The order said that when immigration from the seven countries resumed, persecuted religious minorities would be given preference, and in an interview the day of the signing, Mr. Trump said the United States would give Christians from those countries priority because they had suffered “more so than others.” Judge Robart made clear that his order applied nationwide, citing a similar nationwide injunction from a federal district court in Texas that had blocked President Barack Obama’s plan to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to legally work in the United States. Since Mr. Trump signed his order on Jan. 27, there has been widespread confusion over the policy and disagreement over how it was being carried out, flummoxing immigration lawyers, government officials and travelers. Shortly before the Seattle ruling, a different federal judge, Nathaniel M. Gorton in Boston, ruled in favor of the government by declining to extend a temporary halt to the order in that jurisdiction. Judge Gorton, who was appointed to the bench by the first President George Bush, said that while the nation’s immigration history was a source of great pride and that the plaintiffs in that case — Iranian nationals who are academics — had compelling stories, “the public interest in safety and security in this ever more dangerous world is strong as well.” But that ruling was soon rendered moot, at least for now, by the Seattle ruling. The administration has been criticized for issuing its order without any warning to refugees and visa holders who were on their way to the United States. Some arrived at airports for flights and were turned away. The president’s order allowed for exceptions in the “national interest,” but lawyers for some travelers had described getting one as a Kafkaesque exercise, with the State Department’s website warning that no emergency applications would be heard, and Customs and Border Protection agents at United States airports all but unreachable because their clients were not being allowed to board planes. A wide array of people are affected by President Trump’s order. “It’s quite clear it was not all that thought out,” Judge Leonie Brinkema of Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in yet another court hearing held Friday. “As a result there has been chaos.” Protests over the policy continued on Friday, including a large group that gathered in a parking lot of Kennedy International Airport in New York for the Friday Prayer. One big question surrounded the number of people who were affected by the travel ban. Besides barring refugees and other visa holders from the seven countries from entering the United States, the administration also revoked, at least temporarily, all visas from the seven countries, including those for people currently living in the United States. The revocations, which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings, meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to re-enter the United States if they left. In the Virginia courtroom, spectators gasped when a lawyer for the government told Judge Brinkema, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, that more than 100,000 visas had been revoked as part of Mr. Trump’s order. A State Department official later contradicted that number, saying that it mistakenly included diplomatic visas that were untouched by the ban as well as expired visas. The true figure was “fewer than 60,000,” said William Cocks, a spokesman for the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs. “To put that number in context, we issued over 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year 2015,” he said in a statement. Because the court fights so far have centered on whether judges should impose and keep in place temporary restraining orders, the legal arguments in the last few days have centered on the government’s contention that there is “no potential irreparable harm” to justify keeping the extraordinary orders in place pending fuller briefing and arguments. But Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, who opposed the Trump administration in the Seattle case, said the decision Friday “shuts down the executive order nationwide and immediately.” “I hope the federal government will understand what they did was unconstitutional and unlawful,” he said.\n",
            "\t ...\n",
            "\t Now that a version of President Donald Trump’s travel ban is finally in effect, its critics are having a tougher time getting the courts to tweak it. On Thursday night, Federal District of Hawaii Judge Derrick K. Watson — one of the judges who stopped the travel ban from going into effect back in March — refused to answer a question about whether some relatives of US residents, and most refugees, ought to be banned under the ruling the Supreme Court issued last week. The government is currently barring people from six majority-Muslim countries from getting visas to come to the US for the next 90 days — and (as of next week) barring refugees from entering the US for 120 days — unless they have a “bona fide relationship” with a person or organization in the US. The way the Trump administration is interpreting “bona fide relationships” doesn’t include some relatives like grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles, or refugees whose connection to the US is that a refugee resettlement agency has agreed to assist them when they arrive. Some of the people who took the travel ban to court to begin with think that’s a misinterpretation. Groups sued to get “clarification” on the Supreme Court’s ruling, hoping some of these relatives and agencies would be included, but Judge Watson took a pass and basically said that only the Supreme Court can decide what it means: …the parties’ disagreements derive neither from this Court’s temporary restraining order, this Court’s preliminary injunction, nor this Court’s amended preliminary injunction, but from the modifications to this Court’s injunction ordered by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the clarification to the modifications that the parties seek should be more appropriately sought in the Supreme Court. In practice, this means that grandparents and other relatives the federal government doesn’t deem “close” who come from the six blacklisted countries will stay banned for the foreseeable future (though individuals can get waivers to come to the US in some cases). And it means that once the government lowers the boom on refugees next week, it’s going to get much harder for refugees to qualify to come — though the State Department still hasn’t released final guidance about whether any relationship with a resettlement agency does count as “bona fide.” As law professor Ilya Somin pointed out at the Washington Post, and Supreme Court reporter Lyle Denniston observed on his blog, this is kind of a weird ruling. It’s pretty common for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling and then leave it to the lower courts to figure out exactly how that ruling applies to any future questions the parties have. In fact, Denniston points out, “it is not clear where, in the court’s rules of procedure, there is a provision allowing a motion to clarify or modify,” like the one that got filed in the Hawaii court. (That’s setting aside the fact that the Supreme Court is out of session for the summer; even if the travel ban’s challengers could file a motion, the Court might decide that it wasn’t worth reconvening in the middle of its summer recess to iron out what seems like a couple of wrinkles in an earlier order.) Instead, what’s probably going to happen is that the people who asked Judge Watson to clarify the scope of the ruling will now appeal his denial to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit will then have to decide if Watson is right, and only the Supreme Court can (somehow) decide whether grandparents and refugee resettlement organizations count as “bona fide” relationships, or if Watson is wrong and lower courts can answer those questions. If the latter, it might decide to answer the questions itself, or kick them back down to Watson to answer. It’s fair to say that this probably won’t be resolved quickly. In the meantime, the government’s definition of “bona fide” will stand — which is bad news for grandparents, and (potentially) extremely bad news for refugees.\n",

            "\t EditorsNote: Updates graphs 10-12 on Thompson, Looney injuries TORONTO — It was as if the Golden State Warriors decided enough was enough. After losing Game 1 of the NBA Finals to the Toronto Raptors, they lost the first half of Game 2 Sunday by five points. Then, the two-time defending NBA champions reeled off the first 18 points of the second half and held on to defeat the Raptors 109-104 to even the series at one game each. The next two games are in Oakland, Calif. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he liked his team’s position at halftime. “It felt like we should have been down by a lot more than five,” he said. “For the first quarter and a half, we really had a tough time scoring. So the last whatever it was, four, five, six minutes, the game loosened up and we finally broke free and started getting some buckets. We started to look like ourselves and so at that point, it just felt better and then the second half we got it rolling and we ended up with 34 assists, which is more like our team.” It was not without suspense. The Warriors, who led by as many as 12 during the fourth quarter, had their lead cut to two points on Danny Green’s 3-pointer with 26 seconds remaining. But Andre Iguodala nailed a 3-pointer with seven seconds left to complete the scoring. The Warriors also emerged from the game with two injuries. Klay Thompson, who led them in scoring with 25 points, was limited to four minutes in the fourth quarter with a tight left hamstring. Kevon Looney was limited to 10 minutes for the game with a left chest contusion. “Klay said he’ll be fine, but Klay could be half dead and he would say he would be fine,” Kerr said. “We’ll see. He pulled his hamstring. He thinks it is minor, so I don’t know what that means going forward.” According to reports, after the game the team clarified Thompson didn’t suffer a pulled hamstring but rather has tightness in the area. Thompson was seen limping out of the arena following the game but, according to reports, said, “Oh yeah” when asked if he would be OK for Game 3. NBA.com reported Thompson would undergo an MRI exam on Monday, while Looney would get an MRI exam and CT scan. Kerr offered no update on Looney to reporters. Stephen Curry added 23 points for the Warriors. Draymond Green had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and DeMarcus Cousins added 11 points and 10 rebounds. Kawhi Leonard scored 34 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Raptors. Fred VanVleet added 17 points, Kyle Lowry had 13 points before fouling out late in the fourth quarter and Pascal Siakam notched 12. Serge Ibaka had seven points and 10 rebounds for Toronto. “Well, they were obviously a little more aggressive (than in Game 1) and up in us a little bit,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “I thought we were just a little bit impatient and didn’t hold enough composure just to either, A, get to a strong shot or B, move it to the next one. I thought we would hit an action and something would be there and they would cover it up with some help defense.” After leading by as many as 12 points during the first half, the Raptors led by five at halftime. The Warriors surged to a 34-21 third-quarter advantage to lead by eight points entering the fourth quarter. “We got stops,” Draymond Green said. “We took away their transition buckets and we got transition buckets. We always say we’re at our best. ... When we’re getting stops and we’re pushing the ball.” “Just started too slow,” VanVleet added. “You can’t do that against this team. Missing every shot doesn’t help, whatever, 10 possessions in a row we didn’t score.” Danny Green’s 3-pointer cut Golden State’s lead to four points with nine minutes left in the game, but the Warriors went up by 10 when Quinn Cook hit a pair of 3-pointers. The Warriors went up 12 on Andrew Bogut’s dunk with 5:39 to play. The Raptors cut the lead to eight when Lowry made one of two free throws with 4:26 to play. Lowry fouled out with 3:52 remaining. Curry was hit with a technical foul for flipping the ball in the air with 1:08 to play after Cousins was charged with a foul. Leonard made the technical foul shot, then cut the lead to five when he converted both free throws on the foul charged to Cousins. The Raptors led 27-26 after one quarter and 59-54 at halftime. The Warriors’ surge to open the second half was capped by Draymond Green’s layup with 6:35 remaining in the third quarter. VanVleet ended Golden State’s run with a 3-pointer 15 seconds later. The Warriors led 88-80 after three quarters. —Larry Millson, Field Level Media \n",

            "\t SAN ANTONIO -- The early-season showdown between the San Antonio Spurs and the defending champion Golden State Warriors on Thursday is a prime example of how the eight-month NBA campaign is a marathon, not a sprint. When the two teams square off at the AT&T Center for the first of three regular-season contests, a look at the standings will show that the Spurs and Warriors have had their difficulties over the first three weeks of the year, losing a combined six games already after meeting in the Western Conference finals last year. But it would be foolish, and hasty, to think both teams won&apost be in the mix at the end of the season. Golden State (5-3) heads to the Alamo City on the heels of a 141-113 rout of the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday, which came a day after the Warrior fell at home to the Detroit Pistons. Stephen Curry scored 31 points and Kevin Durant added 19 on Monday as the Warriors cruised to their 11th consecutive victory over the Clippers. The end of October used to be the traditional start to the NBA season, so Warriors coach Steve Kerr simply acted as if he were back in his playing days when he spoke to his team. \"That looked like us,\" Kerr said. \"I told the guys that tomorrow is Halloween, which means that (Monday) was opening night. Training camp is over, so we&aposre back to being us.\" 36 View Gallery  Gallery:Best of NBA Dancers Photo Gallery Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports | Jerome Miron Offense has not been a problem for the Warriors this season, but their defense and taking care of the ball have been below their lofty standards. When Golden State puts all the pieces together, it is nearly impossible to beat. \"Our defense and our turnovers have been kind of our Achilles&apos heel so far,\" Curry said. \"Scoring the ball hasn&apost been a problem. It&aposs just the other things we need to do to be a well-rounded team and the team we expect to be. (Against the Clippers), our defensive effort got us to where we wanted to be, and we kind of controlled the game from the start. We took care of the basketball -- we played Warriors basketball, and now we have to sustain it.\" San Antonio (4-3) heads home after losing three straight games on the road -- to Orlando, Indiana and, most recently, to Boston 108-94 on Monday. It was the Celtics&apos most-lopsided win over San Antonio since March 1997 in Gregg Popovich&aposs first year coaching the Spurs. (San Antonio won 15 games that season). \"We actually played better even though we got our (rear end) kicked,\" Popovich said. \"I saw some things that I liked, but we got a lot of stuff to go over with a lot of new guys.\" The Spurs got a career-high 18 points and five rebounds from rookie Brandon Paul, 14 points from Rudy Gay, and 11 points apiece from LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol. Gasol also pulled down eight rebounds. San Antonio hit 12 3-pointers in 26 tries but went just 10-for-20 from the foul line. Asked if he could take something positive from a 1-3 trip, Popovich said, \"Well sure, that&aposs why you do this. It doesn&apost matter if you win or lose, you can improve in both situations.\" The Spurs have played their first seven games -- and will continue to do so for a while -- without star forward Kawhi Leonard and veteran point guard Tony Parker, both of whom are recovering from quad injuries. Reserve forward Joffrey Lauvergne missed the road trip with a sprained ankle, and Manu Ginobili was held out for rest against the Celtics. Lauvergne will miss the Thursday game as well. On Wednesday, Parker was recalled from his rehab stint with the G League Austin Spurs. San Antonio has given no timeline for Parker&aposs return to the court with the parent club, although he has said he is hopeful it will happen in either November or December The Spurs beat Golden State twice in three regular-season meetings last season before getting swept by the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. Leonard injured his left ankle in the first game of the playoff series and missed the final three contests.\n",

            "\t * Midterms could hinder Trump’s fiscal stimulus, hurt dollar * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Daniel Leussink TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The dollar was down against the euro and yen on Wednesday on investor caution as traders awaited U.S. midterm election results for implications on Washington’s broader economic and political agenda. The U.S. currency has outperformed most of its key rivals this year, benefiting from a robust domestic economy and higher interest rates. Investors are focused on whether congressional elections could disrupt the stellar run of the world’s most liquid currency. The Democratic Party is expected to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives, with Republicans seen likely to keep their majority in the Senate. “If the Democratic Party wins both houses, sentiment will turn risk off, so we’ll see a strong dollar and strong yen,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. “If that does not happen, the dollar will likely strengthen against the yen and sold somewhat against other currencies. It will be risk on, at least temporarily,” he said. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of its major rivals, fell 0.2 percent in early trading to hit a two-week low of 95.902. The euro gained 0.3 percent at a two-week high of $1.1459. The single currency changed hands about 1.4 percent above this year’s trough of $1.1301 reached on Aug. 15. The dollar also fell on the day against the yen, a safe haven sought in times of turmoil and economic stress. The greenback last traded down 0.4 percent at 113.01 yen but remained not far off a four-week high of 113.385 yen scaled last week. A split Congress may hurt the dollar temporarily: a Democratic win in one or both chambers is likely to be seen as a repudiation of President Donald Trump and the policies which have boosted corporate growth. That, in turn, may lift emerging market currencies which have ben hurt this year by rising U.S. interest rates, in particular currencies of countries running big external imbalances, such as Turkey and Argentina. The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $0.7252, adding to two days of gains. The Aussie was 3.3 percent above a more than 2-1/2-year trough of $0.7018 touched on Oct. 28. The pound was 0.2 percent higher at $1.3134, coming off slightly after hitting a three-week high of $1.3140. On Tuesday, sterling slipped as low as $1.3023 before erasing the losses in volatile trading, on growing hopes of a Brexit deal breakthrough. Reporting by Daniel Leussink\n",

            "\t * Dollar on course for loss of 1% this week after Fed  * Yen hits five-month high as Iran-U.S. tensions flare  * Euro supported by better-than-expected business surveys  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds new quote, details, updates prices)  By Tommy Wilkes  LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - The dollar was headed for a big weekly loss on Friday and the euro a solid gain after a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve, and investors also briefly pushed the yen to a new five-month high amid rising tensions between the United States and Iran.  In joining the European Central Bank by opening the door to interest rate cuts and more stimulus to counter an economic slowdown, the Fed sent the dollar to its biggest two-day loss of 2019.  Forex markets were much quieter on Friday, however, as traders took stock.  The focus now shifts to whether the United States and China can resolve their trade row at a summit in Japan next week of leaders from the Group of 20 leading world economies.  Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are due to meet on the sidelines of the G20 next weekend, but analysts say chances of a decisive breakthrough are low.  An escalating dispute between the United States and Iran after the downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone also supported buying of the safe-haven yen, which briefly touched a five-month high.  “The yen is continuing to benefit from the dovish shift in Fed and ECB policy alongside other low-yielding currencies such as the Swiss franc,” said MUFG analysts in a note.  The yen rose as high as 107.04 yen per dollar before falling to trade at 107.52, down 0.2% on the day.  Money markets are pricing in three Fed rate cuts before year-end, starting with the next meeting in July, and tipping as many as five cuts through mid-2020.  The dollar index fell 0.1% to 96.495, its lowest for two weeks. The index is headed for a fall of 1% since Monday.  The euro hit a high of $1.1319, up 0.2% on the day, after French and German business activity strengthened more than expected in June, according to surveys. The common currency, up 0.9% since Monday, later settled at $1.1309.  “The Fed can do more than the ECB; simply because it is further away from the lower limit in interest rates. As a result the net effect is EUR-USD positive if both central banks switch to an “expansionary” stance,” Commerzbank analysts wrote.  The euro rose 0.2% versus the Swiss franc to 1.1106 francs , reversing some of Thursday’s losses.  Sterling skidded 0.3% to $1.2699 and 0.5% against the euro to 89.30 pence, as investors worried that a government under Boris Johnson, the favourite to win the Conservative Party leadership contest, would raise the risk of a no-deal Brexit.  Norway’s crown, which surged on Thursday after the central bank raised rates and signalled another round of tightening in 2019, gave back some of its gains but remained near 2-month highs against the dollar and the euro.

            "\t Republicans have 10 days left to unite behind yet another push to repeal Obamacare — and the Senate is only in session for five of those days. So far, there still aren’t enough Republican votes behind the latest Obamacare repeal-and-replace proposal — a plan from Sens. Lindsey Graham (SC) and Bill Cassidy (LA) that would block-grant existing Obamacare funding, cap federal health care spending, and send it down to the states to create their own health care programs. In effect, analysts say the proposal would cut $215 billion in federal health care funding to states. And there are several procedural hurdles Republicans will have to jump to get this done. In less than a week, Republicans will have to get a score from the Congressional Budget Office and run the proposal past the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide whether this health plan adheres to Senate rules. Already there are hints that Graham-Cassidy could see some pretty substantial changes after that process — which could put more votes at risk. Even so, the Senate is positioning itself to get this done. Senate Republicans’ efforts to ramp up momentum behind the last Obamacare repeal bill left standing has largely seen some success. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence and Seema Verma, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, joined Senate Republicans at lunch to lobby for Graham-Cassidy’s passage. President Trump has voiced his support, and Senate leadership has taken a more active role in whipping the proposal’s vote count. A top committee chair proposed a last-minute hearing to give the bill the appearance of some regular congressional order. If the Senate manages to pass the proposal by September 30, then Graham-Cassidy will still need to go back to the House — where it can no longer be amended. In other words, the Senate needs to be able to pass a version of Graham-Cassidy that the lower chamber will take as is. Already some House members from blue states, who would see the most drastic cuts, have raised concerns. If they all say no, there’s no going back to the drawing board on Graham-Cassidy. None of this will be easy. But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff has written, it’s looking more and more real. Here’s a rundown of the procedural roadblocks that lie ahead. Like last time, Republicans are planning to repeal Obamacare through budget reconciliation, a process that allows the Senate to pass legislation without the threat of the Democratic filibuster. But “budget reconciliation” bills are restricted in what they are able to do — namely, they have to somehow impact federal spending, whether through revenue or spending. They also have to achieve a level of savings overall, and have a hard deadline to get all this done: September 30. Republicans have fewer than seven working days to pass Obamacare repeal If Republicans don’t pass Graham-Cassidy by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, they will no long be able use “budget reconciliation” — meaning anything they pass on health care will have to be done on a bipartisan basis, with eight Democrats on board in the Senate. And Democrats, who have begun some talks on a bill that would stabilize Obamacare’s markets, have made it clear they’re not interested in repealing their signature health care legislation. This has created a very tight schedule for Republicans — and is putting the many senators who decried a lack of transparency and regular order in the past Obamacare repeal debates in a difficult position. When Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was the deciding vote tanking the Republicans’ last push for repeal, he said he wanted negotiations to be bipartisan and to go through a public and thorough hearing process. The sentiment was echoed by many, including the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who was working on a bipartisan health care proposal with Democrat Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) to stabilize Obamacare, until Republicans walked away from negotiations early this week. It will be hard to make the case that this bill went through a thorough debate process under regular order with only a week to pass it. But Republicans are making an effort to make a show of it. For one, the text of this proposal has been out much longer than past iterations of the Obamacare repeal bills. They are quick to say the plan wasn’t written by Senate leadership, and the Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on Monday to debate the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal. This proposal still needs a score from the Congressional Budget Office Graham-Cassidy has not yet received an official score from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan body that analyzes the cost and coverage of bills. Outside analysts expect this bill will lead to millions of Americans losing coverage compared with the existing health law — similar to past iterations of the Republican-led repeal efforts. Cassidy has long expressed that he disagrees with the CBO’s analyses on health care, saying their fundamental model is based on the individual mandate — a provision in Obamacare that taxed Americans for choosing to remain uninsured. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who is a co-sponsor of Graham-Cassidy, has repeatedly said there is no need for more information from the CBO. \"I think we can pretty well decide based on the information we already have,\" he said. But Republicans’ gripes over the CBO score aside, the Senate will still need a score before they vote, in order to know how the bill impacts the deficit — a requirement under budget reconciliation. So far, the CBO has said it cannot release a full report as early as next week but will try to provide as much bare-bones analysis as it can — which Republicans can use to vote if it comes to it. Pence said they were \"lighting a fire\" under the CBO to get this done in time. \"We've been assured that we'll have a score ... by the 25th,\" he said. This bill will have to survive the Byrd Rule The Senate parliamentarian will also have to make sure this bill is compliant with the Byrd Rule, which is supposed to limit budget reconciliation legislation to items affecting federal revenue or spending. As with Republicans’ previous Obamacare repeal proposals, Graham-Cassidy includes several measures that could be gutted from the final bill. While the parliamentarian has yet to make a ruling on Graham-Cassidy, past Obamacare repeal rulings give an early indication that some provisions, like abortion restrictions or allowing states to receive waivers from Obamacare-era coverage requirements, could be stripped from the bill. If provisions like the state waivers are removed from the bill, it could hurt conservative support. As is, conservative Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) seem to be responding positively to this bill, without definitely giving their support. Cruz has already said he is in talks for an amendment that would give states more flexibility on Obamacare regulations. Graham says he has House Speaker Paul Ryan’s assurance that if the Senate gets this done, the House will pass it too. Ryan has called the proposal \"our best, last chance to get repeal and replace done.\" The pressure is on: After September 30, the House will only be given a yes-no vote on Obamacare repeal. They can’t change the bill, because the budget reconciliation instructions already would have expired in the Senate — meaning the upper chamber would then need to meet an almost certainly impossible 60-vote threshold to pass an amended version. The House isn’t beholden to the September 30 deadline like the Senate is, but their hands are tied on the actual legislation. As the Washington Post’s Mike DeBonis wrote, this proposal is not a slam-dunk in the House. On both sides of the ideological spectrum, House members have concerns. House conservatives on board with the proposal, for now, are looking toward Graham-Cassidy’s state waivers. “Having real flexibility for governors and states to provide health care coverage with lower premiums is a critical component for any conservative support,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who chairs the House’s archconservative Freedom Caucus, told Vox. Though he isn’t confident those measures will be kept in after the proposal is reviewed by the parliamentarian. “I have learned to never be confident on anything that had to pass Senate rules or procedures,” he said. But for conservatives, the threat of a “binary choice” — that it’s this or Obamacare — is a more compelling reason to vote for Graham-Cassidy than it is for the party’s moderates, particularly those from largely Democratic states that would see the largest funding cuts under this proposal. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) has already said this proposal would be worse than Obamacare for his state. “Right now, I don’t see how I could vote for it. … It’s extremely damaging to New York,” he said. Another New York Republican, Rep. Tom Reed, voiced similar concerns, calling back to an amendment from his fellow New York Reps. Chris Collins and John Faso, known as the “Buffalo Buyout,” during the House’s Obamacare repeal debate back in March, which made Medicaid cuts more tenable for the state’s counties. “We are waiting to see if this in fact comes out of the Senate,” he said. “I would be concerned that the Faso-Collins amendment, which is critically important for New Yorkers, isn’t included. But to be honest, I’m not overly optimistic the Senate will move this forward.” California Republicans will have to make the same calculus: whether party pressure to once and for all repeal Obamacare will supersede what could be a devastating policy for their states.\n",

            "\t The American public can finally read Senate Republicans’ health bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act or BCRA. For more than a month, a small group of senators has been meeting in secret to negotiate the American Health Care Act, a bill that would repeal and replace Obamacare. In the past week, an even smaller group of Senate leadership members and staffers drafted it — without the input of the majority of the Republican Party, let alone the American public. Now, one week before the Senate is reportedly going vote on the legislation, they have unveiled the legislation’s text. The bill is complex, its text is still being analyzed and we are awaiting a score from the Congressional Budget Office. But in brief, its essential features are: Republican leadership has moved health care reform stealthily and quickly, a deliberate strategy to attract enough moderate and conservative votes while shielding the process from outside criticism. Senate Republicans can only afford to lose two votes on the bill in order to pass the legislation and send it back to the House with their changes. Already the secret process has irked some members of the Senate, who have said it limits their time to come to a conclusion on the bill. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin went so far as to say it would be difficult for him to come to a “yes” vote, given the rushed process. It’s also made Obamacare defenders much harder to mobilize against the secret bill. Now the bill is public. Either it will pass, and move forward to reconcile with the House, or the bill will fail, part of a “show them a body” strategy. We’re about to see if the secret bill strategy works.

            "\t (Reuters) - The European Union has rejected a British request to hold Brexit talks this weekend, British media reported, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated his commitment to leaving the bloc on Oct. 31 despite the possibility of a not reaching an exit deal. The European Commission said that Johnson’s new Brexit proposals do not provide any basis for finalising a separation agreement, according to Sky News. Talks on Johnson’s plan to replace the Irish backstop will not take place over the weekend, EU Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud was quoted as saying by Sky. She added that the UK will be given “another opportunity to present its proposals in detail” on Monday. “If we held talks at the weekend it would look like these were proper negotiations,” the Times newspaper had earlier cited an EU diplomat as saying. “We’re still a long way from that”. Johnson has consistently said he will not ask for a Brexit delay, reiterating the point on Friday. “New deal or no deal - but no delay. #GetBrexitDone #LeaveOct31”, Johnson said in a tweet. However, his government also acknowledged for the first time on Friday that Johnson will send a letter to EU asking for a Brexit delay if no divorce deal has been reached by Oct. 19. Johnson has not explained the apparent contradiction, with opponents believing he will seek some kind of legal escape route to avoid asking for an extension, or try to pressure the EU into refusing to agree to such a request. Johnson’s top advisor said the government will be observing developments over the coming week but will not change its negotiating position, The Times reported. “Next week we are going to know how things turn out,” Dominic Cummings was quoted by The Times as telling other advisers. “If the EU says no then we are not going to do what the last lot did and change our negotiating position. If we don’t get anything next week, we are gone.” Reporting by Kanishka Singh and Sabahatjahan Contractor in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirsten Donovan; Editing by Sandra Maler and Kirsten Donovan\n",

            "\t (Updates with EU official) BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European Union chiefs are so fed up of Brexit that when they clinched a new divorce deal with Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week they did not want to entertain the need to delay Britain's departure beyond Oct. 31. But once Britain sends a letter to seek an extension for the divorce - as now seems likely after Johnson's failure to get the agreement approved in parliament on Saturday - there is very little chance that the other 27 members states would refuse. After a call between Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk on Saturday evening, an EU official made clear, however, that the bloc would not rush. \"The prime minister confirmed that the letter would be sent to Tusk today,\" the official said. \"Tusk will on that basis start consulting EU leaders on how to react. This may take a few days.\" An EU diplomat reinforced that message: \"We won't be rushed by any request.\" The bloc hopes the deal can still pass in the factious House of Commons in time to let Britain leave with a deal on Oct. 31. The EU would, however, need to step in should that start looking unlikely if it wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the end of the month. \"I can't see them refusing,\" Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe and a Brexit expert, told Reuters. \"They don't want no deal and they certainly don't want to be blamed for it.\" EU leaders might end up agreeing any new Brexit date at a hastily convened emergency summit, possibly next weekend. Their ambassadors are due to meet in Brussels on Sunday morning. Britain's parliament voted in favor on Saturday of an amendment that withheld support for Johnson's Brexit deal and as a result he is obliged, by law, to request a postponement. The EU 27 have already agreed twice to postpone Brexit from the original deadline of March 29 this year. FRUSTRATION IN BRUSSELS However, frustration has mounted among them over the distraction of a process that has dragged on for three-and-a-half years since Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU. After the second extension they said it would be the last one, and French President Emmanuel Macron has been the most outspoken and hawkish among the 27's leaders on the issue. His camp stresses the cost of protracted uncertainty in terms of sapping the EU's political capital and attention to face challenges from climate and migration to international crises, as well as economic cost for companies that have invested in contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Despite French misgivings, the EU has repeatedly made clear it would not want to be seen pushing a member state out and that its absolute priority was to avoid any no-deal Brexit, especially one for which it would take the blame if it refused to postpone Brexit. However, an extension can only be granted by unanimity among the 27 and, asked whether there was any serious risk that Macron could refuse it, another EU official said: \"No.\" \"If there is a chance of a deal, they will never choose no deal,\" said Nick Petre, spokesman for the Renew Europe group of liberals in the European Parliament that includes Macron. A ONE-MONTH DELAY? Britain's House of Commons last month passed a law demanding the government seek a delay until the end of January 2020 to avoid an abrupt split on Oct. 31, if a divorce deal is not approved by parliament by Oct. 19. It is possible that the EU 27 will grant a \"technical extension\" of just one month until the end of November to keep pressure on Britain to approve the deal clinched this week. \"It can still just be a technical extension, only until the end of November. And they could still get out of it if they manage to pass it before October 31,\" said an EU diplomat who deals with Brexit. Another EU diplomat said the length of an extension and conditions attached would depend on the purpose behind the request. \"If we still hope to be able to salvage this deal, we'd be looking at shorter ones,\" the diplomat said. \"Then, if we are looking at elections or second referendums, a longer one would most likely be needed. At this stage, it really depends on what happens in Britain in the coming hours.\" Many in Brussels believe there could be no more delays beyond mid-2020 as the bloc needs the rest of the year to prepare its new, long-term budget from 2021 and wants to know whether Britain will go on paying to the joint coffers.

The 38-year-old Venezuelan, who resides one hit shy of the milestone, is vying to become the ninth active player to reach 2,000 when he faces the team with which he played from 2002-09. Martinez recorded back-to-back two-hit, two-RBI performances to open a three-game series versus San Francisco before sitting out Detroit’s 6-2 win in the finale on Thursday afternoon.

            "\t Washington (CNN)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the White House is already crafting a package of tax cuts for the middle class as President Donald Trump hopes to secure a second term in November.  In an interview with CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mnuchin said Trump has already directed his economic team to begin on what the administration is calling \"Tax 2.0.\" \"They'll be tax cuts for the middle class, and we'll also be looking at other incentives to stimulate economic growth,\" Mnuchin said.  Trump has repeatedly dangled additional tax cuts, including before the 2018 midterms. Mnuchin's renewed promise of tax cuts for average Americans comes more than two years after the President signed into a law a massive $1.7 trillion tax package that slashed corporate tax rates, among other things.  The 2017 tax bill along with a two-year spending bill has helped to swell the federal budget deficit, which topped $1 trillion for the 2019 calendar year. The widening gap -- between how much the government spends versus how much it takes in -- comes despite Trump's 2016 campaign promises to shrink or even eliminate the nation's deficit.  Typically, big budget deficits widen during economic downturn, but so far the US economy has continued to expand during one of the country's longest economic expansions.   In the same interview, Mnuchin acknowledged that the US government cannot sustain the federal deficit growing at current levels and will have to reduce its level of spending.  \"There's no question we need to slow down the rate of growth of government spending because we can't sustain these deficits growing at these levels,\" said Mnuchin.  But Trump's top finance chief put the blame on Democrats in Congress for the federal deficit, who requested that non-military spending be increased to meet the President's wishes to boost defense spending.  \n",

            "\t WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tax reform plans won partial support on Friday when Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul said he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, but the party was still far from united over how to achieve the main item on its domestic agenda.   Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget measure that will allow Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic party support.  But Republicans, who control both the Senate and House of Representatives, have yet to produce a tax reform bill as a self-imposed deadline to overhaul the U.S. tax code by the end of the year approaches. The party’s lawmakers differ widely on what cuts to make and how to pay for them.   They are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing so far to make good on their other main legislative ambition: scrapping Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama.   On major world markets, stock prices advanced on Friday, bond yields rose, and the U.S. dollar strengthened on increased hopes that Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans.  Democrats are likely to reject the Trump administration’s tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and people but will bloat the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.  Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, was the lone Republican to vote against the budget measure on Thursday. He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.  On Friday, Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was “all in” for the “biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!” But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan.  Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform, saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.  “The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”    Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package. He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes.  “I don’t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet.  The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks.  The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs, including food assistance for the poor.  As far as spending cuts go, the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $1 billion over the next decade.      That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint.    Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986.      In the current effort, some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples, a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers.       Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments.  The party’s lawmakers agree roughly on lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent but have not settled on a final number.      Trump seeks to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, which he says would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.              Asked how he would make the case that the plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS,  “That’s why we’re introducing the fourth bracket, so that high-income earners do not see a big rate cut and those resources go to the middle class ... and closing loopholes and carve outs which disproportionately benefit the very high-income people.”     Reporting by Susan Heavey and Amanda Becker; Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann; writing by Alistair Bell; editing by Bill Rigby\n",

            "\t The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, but it also signaled its latest rate cut was meant to serve as insurance against negative hits to the economy and not part of a longer rate cutting cycle. Stocks sold off initially but ended mixed and flattish. The Dow was up 36 to 27,147; the S&P 500 ended up 1 at 3,006, while the Nasdaq fell 8 to 8,177. Bond yields rose at the short end, with the 2-year at 1.75%, the rate that most sensitive to Fed policy. The long-end, the 10-year yield was slightly lower at 1.79%. \"I think maybe the market is a little disappointed because they expected the dots to move,\" said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. The Fed displays its interest rate forecasts on a chart, known as the \"dot plot\" and it showed no more rate cuts this year. Art Cashin, head of floor operations at UBS, said some traders in the stock market were looking for two more cuts to be forecast for this year, and some traders were clearly disappointed. \"If they really want to convince people these are insurance cuts, then they're done. They're done for this year,\" Matus said. Matus said global growth and trade remain a concern for the Fed, and it could still make a third cut this year. The Fed trimmed the Fed funds target rate range to 1.75 to 2%, in its second rate cut since July and second in more than a decade. \"If they try to put in a fourth one, there will be a lot more dissenters,\" Matus said. \"My expectation is where the economy is heading over the next couple of months is pretty good. You could make the case you didn't need this cut.\" Matus said he personally didn't see the need for cuts this year. Three of the Fed's voting members voted against the cut, with Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George both opposed for a second time.They don't believe the economy needed looser policy, but they were joined by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who wanted the Fed to be more aggressive with a 50 basis point cut. According to the dot plot, five members had wanted to hold rates steady Wednesday, while five agreed with a quarter point cut and seven others wanted to see at least one more cut this year. The voting members voted seven to three to cut by a quarter point. \"This does skew hawkish,\" said Jon Hill, BMO rate strategist. \"I think it just reflects the committee didn't pre-commit to a third cut this year.\" He noted that the Fed statement and Powell said that the Fed would \"act as appropriate,\" meaning it will make its decisions based on the economy's performance. Powell also said Fed policy is not \"pre-set.\" \"Back in June, the median showed no cut in 2019. This isn't pre-set policy This is we'll see how things progress, and go from there. All things considered, it's largely consensus expectations. but bordering on slightly hawkish,\" Hill said. Powell also addressed a liquidity crunch in the short-term funding market that sent rates spiking there Monday and Tuesday. That is a market where financial institutions fund themselves. The chairman said there were concerns there would be a large demand for cash this week because of Treasury settlements and tax payments, but the Fed didn't anticipate how volatile it would be. Some rates jumped as much as 10% before the market calmed down. The squeeze pushed the Fed's own target rate above its range on Tuesday, to 2.3%. In an unusual move, it rose above the high end of the then fed funds rate range of 2 to 2.25%. The Fed carried out two market operations Tuesday and Wednesday and announced a third for Thursday. Strategists say the cash shortage does not appear to be related to a credit issue and appears to be a cash crunch. During the post-meeting press briefing, Powell said the Fed was monitoring the situation and would act as needed. \"I think we were expecting them to be a bit more aggressive to either confirm a repo facility,\" said Hill. \"By confirming they want to enter the market with a repo facility, as needed, it's not a standing facility but it's kind of a backdoor one.\" Matus expects the short term funding market to be volatile over the next several weeks. \"I can't pinpoint what happened. And I'm not sure anyone can. I'm not sure the Fed knows because he said he's going to learn over the next six weeks. I'm taking away from that that the funding markets are going to be more volatile over the next six weeks.\" Matus said. \"They don't have a solution because in part, they're still learning. The market is very different than it was before the crisis. When we began the restart of normalizing policy, this is one of the things that was going to be a learning experience.\"\n",

Last winter, you may recall, it seemed the Chinese economy might come apart at the seams, as credit had dried up for the private sector — which is where most of the country's growth comes from — and consumers dramatically slowed spending.Then in May, Chinese regulators had to bail out a bank, Baoshang Bank, for the first time in decades.

By June, the Chinese Communist Party was forced to gather all the banks, tell them to get their acts together, and demand that they take haircuts on their investments in each other (a concept the bankers had lost familiarity with during the state's post-crisis credit spree). It is no surprise, then, that the creditworthiness of the Chinese banking system has been trending downward, especially at the lower end.\n",

            "Because of the coronavirus, this weakened banking system — less than one year out from being on a bit of a brink — will now have to forgive loans for companies large and small and continue financing local governments dealing with the fallout from stagnating economies and the effort to fight the coronavirus.

And they don't really know each other's risk,\" Dinny McMahon, the author of \"China's Great Wall of Debt: Shadow Banks, Ghost Cities, Massive Loans and the End of the Chinese Miracle,\" told Business Insider. \"If there was a liquidity event, you might see a flight to safety very quickly, and how the banks define safety may be a bit more severe than it was last year.\"And then, of course, even if the banks could forgive loans and ease credit conditions, that would only do so much. Some businesses simply may not be creditworthy after this economic shock.\"Much of the talk right now is about forcing banks to cut rates, but lower rates won't solve the problem if firms are insolvent,\" Leland Miller, the founder of the business surveyor China Beige Book, said. \"So the issue isn't cost of capital, it's whether the underlying firms are ultimately creditworthy. Depending on how long it takes the economy to get back chugging, that number now may be substantially lower than what it was before the outbreak.\"Then there's the private sectorChina's other financial-system struggle over the past year was ensuring that private-sector companies, mostly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), were getting adequate funding. A lot of these companies used to get financing from China's shadow-banking system, so when authorities cracked down on that in 2017 and 2018, they got squeezed.\n",

            "Authorities spent last year setting up funding mechanisms for them, but the system still isn't working to perfection. This is incredibly important. Chinese state media reported that in 2018, the private sector accounted for 50% of tax revenue, 60% of GDP, and 90% of new jobs and new firms.\"I think they know they're still going to have an issue getting funding to these guys,\" Chu said of the SMEs. \"They are looking at the bond market ... but they had issues with SMEs and bank problems last summer so that isn't straightforward.\"\n",

In these circumstances, the government will need to be very careful about how it manages this situation. This is why China's recovery is going to be a slog, not a snapback.\n",

            "\t * Hubei province reports 14,840 new cases * European stocks follow Asia lower, U.S. futures down too * 10-year Treasury yields drop below 1.6%, European yields dip * Euro struggles after slumping to near 3-year low * Gold jumps 0.6%, oil stumbles back * World FX rates in 2020 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh LONDON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - A sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths and infections unnerved world markets on Thursday, as traders halted the rally in stocks and retreated to the safety of government bonds and gold. Europe's main markets followed Asia into red with London FTSE, Frankfurt's DAX and Paris' CAC 40 extending losses to 1% to 1.5%, as the euro also slumped to near a three-year low against the dollar after a torrid couple of weeks. China reported 254 new deaths, double the previous day's toll and the fastest rise since the pathogen was identified in December. Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated, accounted for 242 of them and confirmed 14,840 new cases, though it was amplified significantly by a switch to using quicker computerised tomography (CT) scans - which reveal lung infections - to confirm the virus. Excluding cases declared using the new methods, the number of new Hubei cases rose by only 1,508, the official data showed, though for markets, the net result was more uncertainty about how long problems are likely to persist. AXA Investment Management's chief economist Gilles Moec said the impact of virus could be part of a \"perfect storm\" for Europe that hurts the economy for months and then gets compounded by a heated trade battle with the United States. \"We started with the premise that this virus would be worse than SARS and that has now become consensus,\" Moec said. \"So attention turns to who is hit the hardest and Europe is among the usual suspects and Germany in particular, given China is its biggest export market. So the reaction of the exchange rate is probably rational,\" he added. The euro bowed as low as $1.0864 and also crumpled to a four-and-a-half-year low against the Swiss franc as wary European FX dealers headed to their usual safe spaces also wondering whether ECB rate cuts might be back in play. Japan's yen strengthened past 110 per dollar, 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell below 1.6% and European yields dropped 3 basis points. Oil slipped again too and E-mini S&P 500 futures were down 0.5%, pointing to a fade in Wall Street's recent strong rally. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had snapped two days of 1% gains to end 0.1% lower as most markets across the region posted modest declines. \"There is no panic on this,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, since the dramatic rise seems so far to be contained to Hubei. The new methodology effectively lowers the bar for classifying new infections, contributing to the spike in cases. Chinese officials said the method is only being used in Hubei, though it was expected to be gradually extended to other regions. The virus has also cast a shadow over life in Asia's financial markets, with Benzimra himself logged in from home and speaking to clients by phone as meetings are increasingly cancelled, even in cities not subject to quarantine. \"Most markets were recouping their losses so that has offered maybe some excuse to sell Asian markets,\" he said. \"But there is not much energy in this.\" Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%. Australia's ASX/S&P 200 index retreated from a record high. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was 0.3% softer. Gold rose 0.6% to $1574 per ounce. FORECASTING GLOOM There was more drama for Brexit-bound British markets too. The sudden resignation of the country's finance minister Sajid Javid caused a jump in both sterling and British government bond yields amid bets his replacement, the 39 year-old Rishi Sunak, will beef up spending. Javid's departure comes less than a month before he was due to deliver his first budget and after just 204 days made him the shortest-serving chancellor of the exchequer since 1970. \"I suspect he (Sunak) is likely to do whatever Boris Johnson tells him to do,\" said Nomura economist George Buckley. \"I don't know what that means for the public finances and fiscal policy but I doubt it will mean tighter fiscal policy.\" The main focus remained the coronavirus though. Markets had taken comfort from the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency programme head describing the apparent slowdown in the epidemic's spread as \"very reassuring\". Yet WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had also warned that it should be viewed with extreme caution. \"This outbreak could still go in any direction,\" he said. Even before the rise in cases, economists were turning more bearish on the likely hit to China's growth as factories idle and supply chains are upended. Citi on Wednesday again downgraded its 2020 GDP forecast for China to 5.3%. The bank had forecast it to be 5.8% in its January outlook, before cutting it to 5.5% two weeks ago. Morgan Stanley believes a gradual, rather than sharp recovery is the most likely scenario. That all bodes ill for regional economies and has weighed on Asian currencies and commodities. The Australian dollar, a liquid proxy for China's economic health because of Australia's export exposure, retraced its recent rally and traded 0.3% softer at $0.6716. China's yuan was 0.1% weaker. Rallying oil prices stalled, with Brent crude down at $55.38 per barrel, 15% below where it was before the coronavirus outbreak.

            "\t WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak business investment. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 210,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for Alabama, California, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virginia were estimated because of Monday's Presidents Day holiday, which left the states with little time to compile the data. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers \"judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,\" and \"expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.\" The Fed also said it \"expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,\" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China. Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 25,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Feb. 8. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 5,250 to 1.72 million. (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n",

            "\t WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to a nearly half-century low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.  But the loss of momentum in activity has left some employers unsettled about the economy’s outlook. Announced job cuts by U.S.-based companies in the first quarter were the highest since 2015, other data showed on Thursday.  Fading stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, the United States’ trade war with China, slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union are casting a shadow over the economy, which in July will celebrate the longest expansion on record.  “We are at a point of inflection where the overall economic trend is changing,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. “That would account for at least some of the volatility and contradictory nature of the data. It would also point to a slowdown not a crash.”  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 for the week ended March 30, the lowest level since early December 1969, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 216,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for California were estimated.  The claims data have shown no significant pickup in layoffs and there have been reports of companies reluctant to let go of workers amid a growing shortage of skilled labor. The scarcity of workers contributed to a recent slowdown in hiring.  Job growth has slowed from last year’s roughly 223,000 average monthly pace. The pace of increase, however, remains more than sufficient to keep up with growth in the working age population, holding down the unemployment rate.  The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.  The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 213,500 last week, the lowest level since early October 2018.  While the claims data has no bearing on March’s employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, economists said it bodes well for an anticipated rebound in job growth.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs last month after a meager 20,000 in February, which was also seen as pay-back after robust gains in the prior two months. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.8 percent.  “We see the initial claims data as consistent with healthy labor market conditions and in line with the widely anticipated rebound in the pace of payroll employment in March,” said Jonathan Millar, an economist at Barclays in New York.  A separate report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers dropped 21 percent to 60,587 in March.   However, announced layoffs in the first quarter jumped 10.3 percent to 190,410 from the last three months of 2018. That was the highest since the third quarter of 2015 and was partly blamed on “economic uncertainty and fears of an upcoming downturn.”  Retailers continued to lead job cuts, purging 46,061 positions in the first quarter. The automotive sector eliminated 8,838 jobs in March, leading to 15,887 layoffs by auto manufacturers and suppliers in the first quarter. Redundancies were also high in the energy and financial sectors.  “Companies are reacting to market conditions as much as consumer demand,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

            "\t (Adds analyst commentary, details on energy infrastructure projects) By David Gaffen Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. crude stocks fell by their most since June, driven by a surge in U.S. crude exports to more than 4 million barrels per day for the first time in history, the Energy Information Administration said on Friday. Crude inventories fell by 11.5 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 27 to 429.9 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 3.3 million-barrel drop. The sharp fall in stocks was in part due to increased refining output that boosted distillate and gasoline stocks, along with a notable drop in imports, and the rise in exports. The United States has only been exporting oil since early 2016, after a four-decade ban on crude shipments worldwide was lifted in response to a surge in U.S. oil production. In that time, construction of shipping terminals and pipelines has surged to deliver oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast for export. That has upended world supplies, sapping the market share of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has throttled back supply to keep oil prices from collapsing. “The U.S. is operating its refining system at or near capacity and so any increases in production are going to go into the export market,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. The nation’s oil transport capacity rose last year as three major new pipelines opened from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Expansions of shipping terminals in the Corpus Christi, Texas, area, also lifted export capacity. U.S. crude futures remained higher on the day following the U.S. killing of an Iranian military commander in Iraq, but pared gains from prior to the report due to the sharp increase in diesel and gasoline stocks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 2.8%, or $1.71 per barrel, to $62.89 a barrel, while Brent crude gained $2.04 a barrel, or 3%, to $68.25 a barrel. “The initial market reaction was higher on that headline crude number, but the product builds are providing that negative influence,” said Tony Headrick, energy markets analyst at CHS Hedging. “We could probably view it as net bearish from the product builds perspective.” Net U.S. crude imports fell by 1.52 million barrels in the last week, EIA said. Refinery crude runs rose by 303,000 barrels in the last week, EIA said. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1.2 percentage points in the week. U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 3.2 million barrels to 242.5 million barrels, the EIA said, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 1.8 million-barrel rise.​ Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 8.8 million barrels in the week to 133.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel rise, the EIA data showed.

            "\t NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices slipped 1 percent on Monday in subdued trading after a long Easter holiday weekend, on news of rising U.S. shale production and profit-taking following three straight weeks of gains. On Monday, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) said U.S. shale production in May was set for its biggest monthly increase in more than two years, adding to worries that these increases would undermine efforts of the world’s top producers to rein in a glut. Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas said market conditions encouraged profit taking. Speculators in the week to April 11 also increased bets on strong performance in both contracts. “The market was overbought so these people are definitely booking profits at this point,” Yawger said. Benchmark Brent crude futures ended the session 53 cents lower at $55.36 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down 53 cents at $52.65 a barrel. Volumes were thin, with about 152,000 Brent futures contracts and about 296,000 WTI contracts changing hands, less than half of Thursday’s trading volumes. With financial markets closed across Europe, the focus was on geopolitical tensions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on May 25 to consider extending output cuts beyond June to reduce a glut that has depressed prices. Iran fed hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would extend the cuts, but Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said it was too early to discuss an extension. “While the Saudis and the Russians have been complying with their cuts we’ve seen Iraq and a number of other countries produce more than their share of the quota,” Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said. “So that gives the market pause at how effective they’re going to be at taking oil out of the market.” Another source of instability is in North Korea. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday warned North Korea that U.S. strikes in Afghanistan and Syria, one of North Korea’s few close allies, showed that the country should not test the resolve of President Donald Trump. Fighting in Libya has cut oil output, but state oil company National Oil Corporation has reopened at least one field. <RIG/U> Many analysts remained positive on oil prices. “We remain constructive on oil prices for the balance of 2017 as second quarter 2017 should see markets tighten as a result of the current OPEC/non-OPEC deal whilst an expected extension of the deal on May 25th should keep oil inventories drawing in the second half of the year,” Citi analysts said in a note. “This should push Brent to $60-65 per barrel.” Additional reporting by Libby George in London, Aaron Sheldrick in Tokyo; editing by David Gregorio and Richard Chang\n",

            "\t North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will visit Russia later this month, the Kremlin said Thursday, in a meeting that offers President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to emerge as a broker in the long-running nuclear standoff and raise Russia’s profile in regional affairs. The Kremlin said in a brief statement that Kim will visit Russia “in the second half of April” on Putin’s invitation but gave no further details. Russian media have been abuzz in recent days with rumors about the rare meeting between the leaders. Putin is set to visit China later this month, and some media speculated that he could meet with Kim in Vladivostok, a Far Eastern port city near the border with North Korea. Kim said last week that he is open to a third summit with U.S. President Donald Trump but set the year’s end as a deadline for Washington to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal. The North Korean leader blamed the collapse of his February summit with Trump on what he described as unilateral demands by the U.S. The meeting may allow Kim to expand his options in talks with Trump and balance the influence of China, the main ally and sponsor of the communist North. Moscow maintained close ties with Pyongyang during the Soviet era, building dozens of factories and key infrastructure, sending supplies and providing weapons for the North Korean military. Those ties withered after the Soviet collapse in 1991, when Moscow cold-shouldered former Soviet allies amid the nation’s economic meltdown.\n",

If Washington and Pyongyang don’t soon secure some deescalating measures in a legally binding agreement, we could be headed straight back to the “fire and fury” of 2017. The promises in Singapore bought some time and goodwill, but they did not change any of the legal factors driving conflict. The two Koreas technically remain in a state of war, sanctions still are crushing North Koreans, and Pyongyang still dismisses the United Nations Security Council ban of its nuclear weapons as a violation of its right to self-defense. A follow-up summit between President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE and Kim Jong UnKim Jong UnPompeo expresses concern over North Korea missile tests State Dept. extends travel ban to North Korea Can we do business with Kim Jong Un? Leadership analysis might give clues MORE in Hanoi also remained legally fruitless. Since then, North Korea has accused the United States of hostile policies that have reduced the Singapore joint statement to a “mere blank sheet of paper.” The reason nuclear talks have been failing for a quarter-century is not that the two sides have no common interests. Both are trying to achieve greater security. They are just pursuing it with means that make the other feel unsafe — one side with a nuclear deterrent, and the other with coercive means to force unilateral disarmament. Both know in fact that there are plenty of legal instruments available that could achieve a shared security that does not come at the expense of the other, such as peace, non-aggression and arms control agreements. The crux of the problem is that Americans and North Koreans utterly distrust each other. Whenever they reach an agreement, they end up convincing themselves that the other is cheating. Yet, rather than address this problem head on by demonstrating as clearly and solemnly as possible their intent to be legally bound, the trend has been towards more and more informality. There never has been a U.S.-North Korea agreement that went through ratification, an otherwise standard procedure for international treaties. The “Agreed Framework” of 1994 was never ratified by the Senate and, while Pyongyang still considered it created legal obligations, the State Department denied it was binding. Tellingly, Congress even refused to fund the concessions the Clinton administration had made to coax Pyongyang into the deal. We cannot expect North Korea to take its obligations seriously when the United States won’t do the same. Later administrations stepped even further away from a legally binding treaty. The first highlight of the George W. Bush era was a “Joint Statement” in 2005, which nearly succumbed to a dispute on sanctions. Then came the ambiguously named “Initial Actions for Implementation” in 2007, which ended because of divergences on verification procedure. Later, the Obama administration’s so-called “Leap Day deal” in 2012 collapsed over a satellite launch even before the public saw evidence of an agreed text. Of course, ratification is not by itself a guarantee that an agreement will hold. Deals last only if both sides believe they are better off with the deal than without. North Korea notoriously withdrew from the Korean War Armistice Agreement and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. record is not spotless either, as recently suggested by the departures from the Iran deal or the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. Refusing to ratify nevertheless is an instant trust-buster. Who would tolerate a businessman refusing to seal a deal with a binding contract? Ratification may be difficult under the U.S. Constitution, which requires two-thirds of the Senate, but it nevertheless remains the expected international norm. North Korea certainly ascribes value to it, as it has ratified agreements with dozens of countries throughout the world, including South Korea. This may help explain why Pyongyang expressed such disdain when the Trump administration offered a non-binding peace declaration, rather than a proper peace treaty. There is simply no military solution to the Korean nuclear crisis — at least none that would come at an acceptable cost to U.S. and allied security, given North Korean counterstrike capabilities. It is urgent that both sides recognize they would be much safer if they agreed to stop the current uncontrolled escalation of tensions. They should then seal this deal as formally, solemnly and bindingly as possible.

The Nikkei rose 1.0 percent to 21,602.69, the highest close since Dec. 13. For the week, the benchmark index gained 0.8 percent and posted its third straight weekly gain. Exporters took advantage of a weaker yen after the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 111.73 yen, the highest level since Dec. 20. “Short-term investors are seen buying back futures while they pick up cheap cyclical shares as the yen is weaker,” said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management.

Griffin produced his sixth 30-point game of the season as Detroit shot 47.5 percent, controlled the paint by a 56-38 margin and posted its fourth straight home win. Reserve Stanley Johnson and starter Reggie Jackson contributed 21 points apiece as the Pistons also won for the seventh time in their last nine games overall. Rookie Allonzo Trier led the Knicks with 24 points and 10 rebounds off the bench but New York saw a three-game winning streak end and was unable to pull off a second straight road comeback after beating Memphis on Sunday. Tim Hardaway Jr. added 19, Damyean Dotson finished with 17 while Enes Kanter contributed 16 and 14 rebounds as the Knicks shot 39.6 percent and missed 18 of 27 3-point attempts. The Pistons began taking control late in the first quarter by closing out the period with a 10-2 run. The Knicks were down five early in the second but the Pistons took their first double-digit lead on a Jackson layup with about seven minutes left and opened a 46-30 lead on Jackson’s 3-pointer two minutes later. By halftime, New York was within 51-43 after Hardaway beat the buzzer with a fadeaway jumper. The Knicks were within 74-68 on a layup by Kanter with 95 seconds left in the third but Detroit held an 81-70 lead into the fourth. Detroit took a 91-74 lead on a layup by Ish Smith with about nine minutes remaining but the Knicks continued to hang around as Griffin returned.

            "\t ATLANTA — Kyrie Irving scored 43 points, LeBron James had 38 and the Cleveland Cavaliers set the N.B.A. regular-season record with 25 3-pointers as they turned back Atlanta’s late rally to beat the Hawks, 135-130, on Friday night. After Paul Millsap’s baseline jumper over James cut Cleveland’s lead to 124-123, Kyle Korver — who was traded from Atlanta to the Cavaliers on Jan. 7 — hit the record-breaking 3-pointer to pad the lead. Cleveland made 25 of 46 3-pointers to break a record that stood less than three months. Houston made 24 3s in a 122-100 win over New Orleans on Dec. 16. Tim Hardaway Jr. made five of nine 3-pointers and led the Hawks with a career-high 36 points. Millsap had 27 points. The Cavaliers set the high-scoring pace with 39 points in the first period. The Hawks also shot well, making 55.6 percent of their shots in the first half, but still trailed by 77-60 at the break. It was an impressive showing by Cleveland, which signed the free-agent center Andrew Bogut on Thursday. Bogut has not yet joined the team. Hardaway’s breakaway dunk cut the Cleveland lead to 6 points at 121-115, but James answered with a 3-pointer. Hardaway had too little scoring help for the Hawks to keep pace with the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers made 14 of 23 3-pointers in the first half. Cleveland finished 4 points shy of their season-high before halftime. It had 81 points in the first half of a 137-125 win over Portland on Nov. 23. Cleveland continued its high-scoring pace and led by 106-88 after three periods. The Cavaliers atoned for a 110-106 home loss to Atlanta on Nov. 8. That was Cleveland’s only loss in their last 12 games — including the postseason — against the Hawks since the 2015 playoffs.\n",

            "\t China's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace since 2012 in September as factories cranked up output to take advantage of strong demand and high prices, easing worries of a slowdown before a key political meeting next month. Production, total new orders and output prices all improved to the highest level in at least a year, while a pick-up in a reading for the construction sector indicated a building boom is undiminished. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Saturday rose to 52.4 in September, from 51.7 in August and well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. It marked the 14th straight month of expansion for China's massive manufacturing industry and the highest reading since April 2012. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would ease slightly. The data comes ahead of the Communist Party Congress in mid-October, a once-every-five-years meeting where new leaders are appointed and the government's key political and economic initiatives are laid out, though details are usually not announced until much later. China's manufacturers are reporting their best profits in years, fuelled by government-led infrastructure spending, a strong housing market, higher factory-gate prices and a recovery in exports. \"Over the short term, we believe the resilient demand growth and disciplined balance sheet expansion ... will point to further improvement in manufacturing profitability and investment returns,\" analysts at China International Capital Corporation said in a note after the data. But cost pressures from high raw materials prices and continued underperformance of smaller firms mean some manufacturers are still struggling. \"Mid- and downstream industries are worried about a further increase in cost pressures,\" National Bureau of Statistics official Zhao Qinghe wrote in comments published with the data. The latest survey showed input prices continued to rise at a solid clip, with the reading at 68.4 compared with 65.3 in August, benefiting upstream producers such as miners, smelters and oil refiners. Indexes for raw materials prices in the paper, wood processing and furniture, and chemical products manufacturing industries were all above 75.0, said Zhao, indicating large price increases. Output prices also rose but at a slower pace, pointing to lower profit margins for companies further along the supply chain who are unable to pass on all of the price increases to their customers. A separate PMI on the steel industry fell to 53.7 in September from 57.2 in August but remained in solid expansion territory, as the industry faces production restrictions aimed at reducing choking air pollution over the winter. Analysts at China Merchants Securities said stricter production limits related to efforts to improve air quality and supply-side adjustments from capacity cuts had helped to improve the supply-demand balance, with new orders rising faster than production in September for the first time since 2012. For the manufacturing sector overall, inventories of raw materials and finished goods continued to decline in September, providing little indication that factories were stocking up in preparation for winter production cuts. Big firms saw the strongest improvement in September, with a large firms sub-index rising to 53.8, while one for small firms improved slightly but was still in contraction territory at 49.4. China's cabinet on Wednesday said that China will take a number of measures, including tax exemptions and targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts, to encourage banks to support small businesses. The impressive performance for China's manufacturers comes despite a government push to shutter outdated industrial capacity and clean up polluting industries, though some analysts say official claims of massive capacity cuts are misleading as overall production is still rising. Chinese authorities are also in the midst of a campaign to reduce the risks from a rapid build-up in debt produced by years of credit-fuelled stimulus, and the continued strength of the industrial sector could give policymakers confidence to stick to the push for deleveraging. A separate private survey may temper some of the enthusiasm, as it showed growth slowed in September amid high pricing pressure and slower new order growth. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.0 in September, compared with 51.6 in August, as new export order growth slipped. So far, the regulatory clampdown has focused on the financial sector, particularly interbank and shadow banking activity, and the pass-through to the real economy appears to be limited. But S&P last week downgraded China's sovereign credit rating, saying the government's deleveraging drive has progressed slower than expected, leading to higher economic and financial risks. An official survey on the services sector published Saturday rose at the fastest pace since 2014, though gains in that sector were also driven by higher input prices. A sub-reading for the construction sector rose to 61.1 in September from 58.0 in August. The official data showed firms in both the manufacturing and services sector continued to shed workers.\n",

            "\t BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s services sector activity expanded at its fastest pace in over three years in December on solid growth in new business, with the outlook improving to a six-month high, a private sector survey showed on Thursday. The upbeat findings broadly echo those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector last week that showed activity accelerated at a faster rate in December than the previous month, reinforcing the view that an expected slowdown in the broader economy would be gradual. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in December, from 51.9 in November and the highest reading since August 2014. A reading above 50 indicates growth, and a reading below signals contraction on a monthly basis. New business increased at the fastest pace since May 2015, with survey respondents reporting sales supported by strong underlying client demand and new projects. China’s leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance economic expansion from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power at home and abroad. The survey also showed input price inflation for services firms in China in December matched March’s reading at 53.8, higher at 51.7 in November. Companies were able to pass through higher input costs to clients, though at a slightly slower pace than in November. A similar private sector survey of manufacturers on Tuesday also suggested input costs remained high, fueled by China’s government’s tougher pollution measures in a battle against thick winter smog. That report showed the manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace in four months as firms cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders. Driven by strong readings in both the services and manufacturing sectors, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI rose to 53.0 in December, compared to 51.6 in November and the highest in a year. “Expansions in total new orders and new export business supported optimism among manufacturers and service providers towards the business outlook for next year,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report. “Although China’s economic growth remains under downward pressure, it is still resilient. However, special attention should be paid to whether future policies will become tighter than expected.” The world’s second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of 2017, supported by a construction boom and robust exports. Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

Many euro zone government bond yields have retreated to new record lows this week as ECB policymakers unite behind a pledge for more stimulus, with Italian debt in particular benefiting from the promise of more central bank largesse. In addition, Italy cut its 2019 budget deficit target on Monday in an effort to avoid European Union disciplinary action over its public finances, potentially easing another major concern for markets. Italian one-year government bond yields hit a new one-year low of 1.916%, a level last seen in May 2018 before the government of League and 5-Star Movement was formed. The closely-watched spread between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields was at its tightest level since September 2018, when budget clashes between Italy and the EU were in full swing. \"The move is at least partly driven by the general massive drop in (euro zone bond) yields from expectations of a very expensive ECB policy,\" said DZ Bank rates strategist Christian Lenk. \"There is also growing optimism of a budget agreement, and a feeling that the European Commission has been less aggressive than expected in punishing Italy,\" he said, referring to the EU's decision not to immediately impose sanctions on Rome for breaching a budget promise. He added however, that he does not share the market's optimism, and expects budget clashes to resume in the autumn when Italy is formulating its 2020 budget, potentially hurting Italian debt in the process. Other euro zone government bond yields edged lower, having dipped to record lows on Monday on the back of dovish comments from ECB policymakers. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, briefly hit a new record low of -0.365%, but was broadly unchanged on the day. Spanish and Portuguese 10-year yields dropped by about a basis point each, hitting new record lows of 0.326% and 0.402% respectively. Euro zone money markets are now pricing in a 50% chance of a 10 basis point rate cut by the ECB in July, up from the 40% chance priced in last week.

            "\t ROME, June 12 (Reuters) - Italy’s economy will grow by 1.3 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, raising a previous projection of 0.8 percent thanks to a broader euro zone recovery and supportive fiscal and monetary policy. However, growth will slow to around 1 percent in 2018-20, the IMF said in a report following its annual Article IV meetings with the Italian authorities, reiterating its frequent calls for Rome to adopt urgent structural reforms. “Weak productivity and low aggregate investment remain key challenges for faster growth, held back by structural weaknesses, high public debt, and impaired bank balance sheets,” the report said. Italy’s public debt, at around 132 percent of gross domestic product, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece’s, and its banks are weighed down by some 350 billion euros ($391.93 billion) of soured loans. The IMF’s improved growth outlook for this year, compared with its 0.8 percent forecast made in April, follows a better-than-expected first quarter, when the economy expanded by 0.4 percent from the previous three months. “The overarching challenge is to boost productivity, which requires more ambitious policy efforts and broad and sustained political support,” the IMF said. Its new 2017 growth forecast is higher than that of the government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, which sees expansion of just 1.1 percent. However, if achieved it would still leave Italy in its customary position among the most sluggish euro zone economies. Gentiloni’s administration is backed by a broad but fragile coalition and there is frequent speculation that it may collapse in the autumn, leading to a general election some six months ahead of the end of the legislature in May 2018. On public finances, the IMF called Italy’s official target of reducing the budget deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic product next year “appropriate”, although the government recently proposed making the goal less ambitious. The target for this year’s deficit-to-GDP ratio is 2.1 percent. ($1 = 0.8930 euros) (Reporting By Gavin Jones)\n",

            "\t DUBAI, June 5 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Qatar and the rest of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council look set to drop on Monday after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Saudi Arabia said it had severed all land, sea and air contacts with Qatar. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways said it would suspend flights from Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their borders. With an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund, a trade surplus of $2.7 billion in April alone and extensive port facilities, Qatar appears likely to be able to ride out the impact without any economic crisis. The GCC states do little merchandise trade with each other, instead relying on imports from outside the region, and Qatar’s liquefied natural gas shipments by sea are expected to continue normally. GCC investments in Qatar’s stock market are believed to be minor. Nevertheless, the diplomatic rift - the worst in years - is expected to have a considerable impact on investor sentiment, outside Qatar as well as within the country. “All GCC markets will fall today - this is unprecedented and we are entering unknown territory. This is not good news for the markets,” said a Dubai-based portfolio manager. “The markets have been quiet in search of a catalyst, and this is it...There will be a lot of exiting today.” After Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar in March 2014, the Qatari stock market immediately tumbled 2.3 percent and remained weak for about three weeks, before rebounding strongly as Qatar entered MSCI’s emerging market index. Some fund managers said Qatari banks could be hardest hit. “Qatari banks that are exposed to those countries that have severed ties with it will be very vulnerable, and vice versa - companies that have borrowed from Qatari banks may have to figure out how to negotiate loans and deals,” said a Doha-based asset manager. Also, some Qatari banks have been borrowing from overseas to offset tight liquidity in the domestic money market; they may now find it more expensive to borrow. (Editing by Andrew Torchia)\n",

The rupee closed at 156.10/15 per dollar, compared with Wednesday’s close of 156.05/15. It touched an all-time low of 156.20 per dollar on Monday, which was hit on Friday. “Demand was there from foreign banks, as well as from a state bank. The (dollar) conversions were very thin,” said a currency dealer. The rupee has weakened 1.76 percent so far this year after declining 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. The currency is expected to remain under pressure on continued importer demand for dollars ahead of the traditional New Year in April, dealers said. A gradual depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year are expected on account of debt repayments by the government, they added. The International Monetary Fund said on March 9 that Sri Lanka’s economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks due to its large public debt and low external buffers.

Rupee forwards were active, with the spot-next at 147.45/55 per dollar as of 0646 GMT, compared with its previous close of 147.40/50. The spot rupee was quoting at 146.90/95 per dollar, but was hardly traded. It was steady last week after two weeks of losses. The spot rupee is usually managed by the central bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency. “We see both importer dollar demand and foreign selling in local bonds,” said a currency dealer, asking not to be named. “There is a bit of uncertainty with the budget coming up next month. So all are waiting for some firm direction.” The government’s national budget is scheduled to be announced on November 10. The central bank has been buying dollars from the market to accumulate reserves to meet targets set by the International Monetary Fund under a $1.5-billion loan deal, dealers said. Officials at the central bank were not available for comments. Dealers said they expected the rupee to remain under pressure due to seasonal imports. Sri Lankan shares were steady, with the benchmark Colombo stock index up 0.02 percent at 6,445.84 as of 0649 GMT. Turnover stood at 152.6 million rupees ($1.04 million). $1 = 147.3000 Sri Lankan rupees\n",

            "\t Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.

Day One 7:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off slightly earlier than usual because I have a doctor's appointment before work this morning. I spend 15 minutes on my phone and cuddling the cat before getting up. It's freezing — my thermostat says 59 degrees. I'm cheap and hate paying for heat in Phoenix, but I'm SO cold. Sixty-six degrees it is. While my apartment heats up, I get dressed, brush my teeth, deal with my hair, and grab the food I packed for breakfast and lunch today. I'm out the door by 8:25. 8:40 a.m. — At the doctor ($20 copay). I only moved here seven months ago, so this is my first time at this doctor. I'm relieved that I like her — I hate finding new doctors! She writes me the prescriptions I need and gives me a list of psychiatrist referrals. Under normal circumstances, a PCP could probably manage the anxiety med I've been on since I was 17. But my younger brother committed suicide six months ago, and I feel like this is a situation where a psychiatrist might be better — I was seriously concerned that I might have PTSD during the holidays, and if I ever feel that bad again, I want to have a psychiatrist around. $20 9:10 a.m. — Leave the doctor to go to work. I'm feeling kind of weird during the drive. I knew I'd have to mention my brother's suicide, but saying it out loud is still so hard. I get to work 10 minutes late to a meeting with my boss and some of her students, but it's fine because I gave her a heads up that I'd probably be late today. 10:15 a.m. — My first meeting of the day is over, so I head to my office for a little while before the next one. I eat the two bran muffins I packed for breakfast while reading emails. I have to eat lunch super early today, because I'll be in meetings from 12 to 3, so I heat up the corn and scallion strata I brought around 11:40. I made it last weekend and want to eat it every day, it's so good! 12 p.m. — Meeting number 2! I learn that my boss is putting me on an interesting project because she thinks I'll be good at it. It's a relief to hear — I got off to a really rough start at this job because of my brother's death one month after I moved cross country and started here. My boss was great, because she dealt with something similarly devastating and understood a lot of what I was going through. I'm glad I'm at the point where she trusts me to work on a big project. 2:30 p.m. — My friend/coworker and I grab coffee from Starbucks — I get a grande iced coffee and pay with the balance on my app. We also decide to go to a farmer's market on Sunday because the weather is so nice and we both need to get out of our apartments. After she goes to her next meeting, I head back to my office for the rest of my day. 4:30 p.m. — I end up crying while driving home. This hasn't happened in a while. After my brother died, I used to cry anytime my brain went on “autopilot” — whenever I was driving, showering, or trying to sleep. It sucks, but I'm glad the random crying is at least happening less frequently. I pull it together and stop by Target on my way home. I pick up the three prescriptions my doctor ordered earlier ($30.30) and get a box of trash bags because I'm running low ($10.85). I get seriously tempted by a clearance mug, but I need another mug like I need a punch to the face. Every time I go to Target, I feel like I need blinders to keep myself from buying anything unnecessary…does Target sell blinders? $41.15 5:30 p.m. — After Target, I head to PetSmart. I get cat litter, food, and a $1 toy. I also look at the cats they have for adoption because I think my cat needs a friend. He hates being left alone and has a lot of energy, so I think he'd benefit from having another cat around while I'm at work. Gotta make sure I can afford one first, though. The food is on sale and I have a coupon, yay. $42.03 6 p.m. — I get home and realize I now have a trunk full of stuff that needs to get dragged up to my third-floor apartment. I'm happy being single most of the time, except when I have tons of heavy groceries or bags to carry by myself. I'd rather split the bags with another person than have to make multiple trips or lug way too many bags by myself! Once I get inside, I disinfect the cat's litter box because it's smelling bad. Really glamorous Friday night, y'all. 6:30 p.m. — I take out the trash and head out again to buy groceries. I did a big run last week, so I don't need a ton today. At Safeway I buy diced tomatoes, tomato paste, aluminum foil, bacon, baby carrots, fresh ravioli, and a frozen pizza ($19.06). Then I go to Trader Joe's, which is dangerous because I'm starving. Amazingly, I don't veer too far off my list. I get two dozen eggs because I've been baking a lot, pesto, more fresh ravioli, sour cream–and-onion corn puffs, and mini stroopwafels ($14.84). $33.90 7:30 p.m. — Finally home for the night! I make the frozen pizza for dinner. I stopped eating out to save money and improve my cooking skills, but I sometimes get frozen pizza on Fridays if I don't feel like cooking or eating leftovers. It's cheaper than takeout yet still kind of feels like it, so I don't feel deprived. 8 p.m. — The cat and I cuddle and watch the new episodes of Grey's Anatomy, How to Get Away with Murder, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. You can absolutely judge my taste in TV. I also read an obnoxious thread in my neighborhood Facebook group about teenagers being “ingrates” in local stores after school hours. I live in a fairly affluent area with a lot of older people who seem to be very worried about their neighborhood “degrading.” I definitely don't condone things like shoplifting or doing anything to make retail workers' jobs harder, but a lot of these people seem to be mad about teenagers…existing…in public… I have nothing in common with most of the people in this group, but I stay because the ridiculous drama is so entertaining. 1 a.m. — Time for bed. I take my meds, clean my face with micellar water, swipe a Stridex pad across my face, put some Bite Agave Lip Mask on, and get in bed. I scroll through Instagram until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $137.08 Day Two 1 p.m. — It's late, but I let myself sleep in on weekends if I don't have anything to do, because I frequently don't sleep well during the week. I get up and start grating carrots, because I'm making carrot cake pancakes for brunch! I've started cooking myself brunch every weekend, mostly as a self-care thing. I look forward to it all week. The carrot cake pancakes take me forever, but they use up all the carrots, cream cheese, and walnuts I had left in my fridge, plus some of the buttermilk! Score. And they're delicious. I freeze the leftovers for another day. 3 p.m. — I read today's Money Diary and cry — the diarist lost her sister recently, and I relate so much to a lot of what she says. It's so, so hard, especially living so far away from my family and not knowing very many people here. Sometimes I think it's a miracle I'm still alive and doing okay. But it's not a miracle; it's strength and bravery I didn't know I had. I try to remember that when grief gets hard. Someone in the comments recommends a group for younger people who have experienced significant loss — I'm definitely going to look into it. The prospect of meeting new people in a new city while grieving is terrifying to me, but I could really use some friends. I love the idea of hanging out with people who have been in similar situations. 4:30 p.m. — My mom has sent me like eight texts today; she's cleaning out my brother's room and trying to decide what to keep or donate. I just call her because it's easier than texting. We talk about what to do with certain things and segue to my other brother, who is doing his best to distance himself from the rest of our family. Kind of feels like I lost two brothers and like my parents lost two sons. 5:30 p.m. — I decide to do my tax return by myself for the first time ever. It only required one phone call to my dad, and only because I didn't have last year's AGI. I'm excited to see that I'm getting almost $2,000 back! I'm NOT excited to see that I have to pay $40 for federal, $40 per state (I had to file in two this year because I moved), and $40 for direct deposit. Maybe I didn't read closely enough, but I expected $40 to cover everything. I have the $160 deducted from my federal return and do the responsible thing and have everything else deposited directly into my high-yield savings account. 8:30 p.m. — Done with everything tax-related! My friend might come over after the farmer's market tomorrow, so I pick up my apartment a little bit and disinfect all the counters. 9:30 p.m. — I made enough tofu stir-fry to feed a small country the other day, so I eat some of that for a very late dinner. Then I watch Chopped while I go through the list of psychiatrists my doctor gave me yesterday and see who takes my insurance. There are only six who do, but at least that narrows down my search. I omit two for being too far away and one for having concerning reviews. Then I choose one and will try to call and schedule an appointment on Monday. Afterward, I apply to be matched to a table with The Dinner Party, the organization I learned about through the comments. I've been to a suicide-loss survivors' support group, but it's intense. I LOVE the idea of a more relaxed dinner-party setting for people my age to talk about loss, since most of our friends haven't experienced it and don't know how to help. 12:30 a.m. — These sour cream–and-onion corn puffs have the texture of packing peanuts. Not a fan. Mini stroopwafels are much better, in case you need a recommendation for hungry Trader Joe's shopping. 1 a.m. — Meds, skin care (micellar water, Stridex, Glow Recipe Watermelon Moisturizer, and Agave Lip Mask), and Instagram scrolling in bed until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $0 Day Three 9:45 a.m. — I set an alarm today because I'm meeting my friend at a farmer's market. I still can't figure out how to dress for Phoenix weather, but it's in the 40s, so I go with leggings and a flannel shirt. I have two leftover bran muffins that I try to eat, but it tastes like the berries inside have gone bad. Will have to remember to freeze half of them next time I make this recipe. 10:30 a.m. — My friend is running a few minutes late, so I sit in my car and do a stupid thing — look at my skin in broad daylight. Where did all these dry patches come from?? Yikes. When she arrives, we walk around the market. I've never been to this one, but it's cute! And the vendors are very generous with samples, which is nice since I didn't really eat breakfast. I end up buying dessert empanada cookies filled with dulce de leche. I didn't expect to like them so much, but they melt in your mouth. Yum. $4.50 12 p.m. — We decide to get coffee at a café near my apartment. I love this place and they have the best cold brew, but I try not to go too often because it's expensive. I spend $6.37 on a cold brew with mocha syrup, which includes $1 in tip. We sit and talk about work, life, and grief. When we're done, we stop by my apartment because she wants to meet my cat. $6.37 1:45 p.m. — She leaves and I head to the library to look for cookbooks. I love the idea of having a big cookbook library, but books are heavy, and historically, I've moved a lot. So I decided to start checking them out from the library — if there are any that I particularly like, I'll consider buying them. I check out The Best of America's Test Kitchen 2016, Cravings: Hungry for More, Barefoot Contessa at Home, and The Red Rooster Cookbook. 2:15 p.m. — Home and hungry after my weird breakfast of samples. I eat some more tofu stir-fry and watch Chopped. Usually I do a lot of chores on Sundays, but my apartment is fairly clean and I'm not at an urgent situation with laundry yet. It's nice to relax! 5:30 p.m. — I'm freezing, so I get in bed and scroll through Instagram. I end up taking a nap, which I will probably regret later, but it feels great now! 7 p.m. — For dinner I make all the fresh ravioli I bought on Friday and eat some of it with pesto. While it cooks, I put away dishes and grind coffee beans for tomorrow morning. 8 p.m. — I make Smitten Kitchen's Perfect Blueberry Muffins for breakfasts this week. I was skeptical about these being perfect, but they absolutely are. They only use one bowl, make nine instead of 12 (which is better for a single person), are topped with turbinado sugar (which I now top everything I bake with thanks to this recipe), and taste amazing. Also, the batter is really good, which is important to me. I do the dishes while they bake. I also see that my dad sent me a text reminding me that I have $1,250 of inheritance money. It was actually my brother's from when our grandma died over a decade ago, and when my brother died my parents generously decided to split the remaining money between my other brother and me. I totally forgot about it, but I decide to put it in my high-yield savings account when I get it. 1 a.m. — After watching MasterChef and reading through Cravings for a few hours, I'm finally tired. That nap definitely messed me up; I try not to go to bed so late on weeknights. Meds, skin care, and Instagram scrolling. The usual. Except…I can't sleep. I realize it's been exactly six months since my brother died. I start having flashbacks to that day. And then I go back another six months, to one year ago. I was living with my parents and brother, working retail. I never in a million years would have been able to predict what my life is like now. Not that it's all bad. It's just completely overwhelming to go through so many major changes in such a short amount of time. Daily Total: $10.87 Day Four 8 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I'm sad and exhausted. I didn't sleep well at all last night between the insomnia, crying, and the cat who woke me up multiple times. I decide to text my boss and tell her I'm taking a sick day. It's really a mental-health day, though. I hate doing this, but I can't even pull myself out of bed right now, let alone drive to work and be productive. After texting my boss, I turn off all my alarms and go back to sleep. 2 p.m. — Part of me hates when I sleep in so much, and part of me tries to be kind to myself. My brain is healing from a traumatic situation — maybe that requires extra sleep? Or maybe I'm just having a rough day. I reheat some carrot cake pancakes and watch more MasterChef. 6 p.m. — I notice that my friend, G., texted me earlier. I'm shocked to see that she remembered it's been six months today. G. is the only one of my friends who has gotten the whole “supporting a grieving friend” thing right. She checks in on me regularly, asks me how I'm doing, and texts me cute pictures of her cat. I don't think it's actually that hard, but I think a lot of people don't know how to react to a grieving person, especially if they haven't experienced major loss. Then again, G. hasn't experienced loss, and she gets it right by asking me what I need and giving it to me. I'm so grateful for her. 6:45 p.m. — I finish the tofu stir-fry leftovers. Totally making that again next week, since it turned out so well. Afterward, I finish looking through Cravings. I'm tempted to buy it, but I'm not sure yet — there are a lot of meat dishes, and while I'm not vegetarian, I don't cook a ton of meat so I can keep my grocery costs down. 10:30 p.m. — Feeling just about every emotion right now. I don't know if it's reasonable for me to be upset that two of my good friends didn't check in with me today. And rarely check in with me ever. I don't need or want them to tiptoe around me, and we talk about other things, but how hard is it to ask your grieving friend how they're doing once in a while? But at the same time, would I be any better if roles were reversed? Grief is scary and uncomfortable to everyone, especially those who aren't familiar with it. But you know what else is scary? Grieving alone, far away from my family and friends, without much of a support system in my new state. I really struggle with whether I'm being too understanding when they're actually being bad friends. 1:30 a.m. — Meds, skincare, insomnia, and crying. I honestly haven't had such a hard time with grief since the holidays. I'm hoping it has something to do with the six-month mark and that things go back to “normal” soon. Daily Total: $0 Day Five 8 a.m. — Wake up after another terrible night of sleep. I'm tired, I have a headache, and my sinuses are making my entire face hurt. I don't have any reason to physically be at work today, so I decide to work from home so I can get a little extra sleep. 9 a.m. — I notice a text from my best friend. He was supposed to call me this past weekend but didn't. The text doesn't acknowledge the missed call, and I'm a little mad. He visited me recently and I poured my heart out to him about my grief struggles. You'd think he'd be able to send a text saying, “Sorry I'm not able to chat this weekend. Let's reschedule for ___.” I don't respond because I don't really have anything nice to say. 10 a.m. — I finish the last of the carrot cake pancakes. So good. I'm thinking next weekend I'll make French toast with whipped honey-ricotta topping from Cravings. 5:30 p.m. — It's only Tuesday, but I need a serious reset on this week. I take a shower and exfoliate my face with Lush's coffee mask, deep-condition my hair, and use a pumice stone on my heels. After I shower, I strip the sheets off my bed and put in a load of laundry. I might feel bad, but at least I'm clean, exfoliated, and going to be sleeping in a freshly made bed. While the washer's going, I eat some ravioli with pesto and have a glass of white wine. I'm not a huge drinker, and I try to be especially careful now because I don't want to numb my feelings or feel dependent on alcohol. But the few times I've had alcohol since my brother died, I've paid close attention to how I feel, so I know I'm going to be fine with one glass. 7 p.m. — Decide to update my lab's Google Calendar because I've been putting it off for too long. Also get a text from my mom telling me the stir-fry recipe I sent her turned out way too salty. Turns out I accidentally typed 3/4 cup of reduced-sodium SOY SAUCE instead of chicken broth. That'd do it. I feel kind of bad for ruining their dinner, but she assures me it was great for the ice on the sidewalk. 9:30 p.m. — I see that Aerie has a 10 for $30 sale. I'm tempted to go for it, but luckily for my wallet, I don't see any pairs that I really like. I try to spend under $200/month on all non-recurring-bill, non-grocery purchases. (I give myself another $200/month for groceries.) It's very restrictive and not always possible, but I attempt it so I can save as much as possible. I'm getting close to $200 for this month, though, so I'd prefer not to spend the $30 now anyway. 10:30 p.m. — I put away the laundry that's done and finally make myself fold and put away a ton of towels and sheets. Afterward, I put on a sheet mask because my skin has been feeling dry. I usually hate sheet masks because they feel cold and slimy and never fit my face right, but I got this Glow Recipe one in a set and figured I should try it. It's actually not bad. The cat thinks it smells interesting, too. 12:30 a.m. — Skin care's done, so I take my meds and look through a cookbook on my Kindle in bed. I'm feeling somewhat better mentally, which is good because I have a busy day at work tomorrow. 1 a.m. — The cat gets stuck on a high shelf in my closet, where he was sleeping. I get the stepladder and rescue him. That fool is lucky he's so cute. Daily Total: $0 Day Six 7 a.m. — Rudely awoken by an early morning leaf blower outside my window. Luckily, I can sleep through anything, so I do just that until I really need to get up. 9:20 a.m. — I don't need to be at work until 10:30, and I know I'm going to be working late-ish tonight, so I let myself sleep in. I get dressed, throw on some concealer and liquid lipstick, and scarf down a blueberry muffin. I'm going straight to a lab this morning, and I can't have food or drinks inside. Oh, coffee. I will miss you dearly this morning. 10:30 a.m. — Into the lab! I've never worked in here before, but it's in my favorite building with free coffee. As I expected, almost everyone else is late. 1:30 p.m. — It's apparent I'm going to be in the lab the entire day. We break for lunch. I brought a hummus bowl that I made a few weeks ago and froze — it has brown rice, lentils, edamame, sweet potato, chicken, and homemade hummus. For once, I eat with coworkers. It's really easy for us all to isolate ourselves, so it's nice to have some human interaction. Especially because I like my coworkers! 2 p.m. — I spend the rest of the afternoon working on calibrating a device, responding to emails, and editing the lab's website. There is so much natural light in this building, and I think it makes me way more productive. 6 p.m. — My boss wants to meet tomorrow. I always freak out when she asks to meet and doesn't tell me why — it makes me worry I'm doing something wrong! But I know realistically things are probably fine. My coworkers and I leave after planning to meet on other days, because we still have work to do on this project. 6:45 p.m. — Home! I bring in my mail and see that my Old Navy Pixie Pants arrived. I really needed a basic black pair of work pants — we don't have any sort of dress code, but I try to look somewhat more professional than I need to, so I'm taken seriously (and not mistaken for a student). I'm absolutely shocked when I try them on and they fit perfectly and look great! Y'all. Well-fitting pants are impossible for me to find. Definitely going to have to get some more pairs when they go on sale. 7 p.m. — Face washed, bra off, and hair up. I'm in for the night. For dinner I make a recipe with a very high taste-to-effort ratio: chickpeas in a creamy tomato-and-smoked-paprika sauce, with eggs poached in the sauce. So good. So easy. 9 p.m. — I get an email saying my credit score changed. Somehow it went up over 40 points in the last month? I'm guessing because I'm putting less on my credit card now that I'm trying so hard to save. Regardless, awesome. 12 a.m. — I wash the dishes in my sink, take my meds, and do my skin care. I notice that the cat made catnip-toy soup in his water dish (again), so I fish out the offending toy (a very wet squirrel that was actually meant for dogs) and get him fresh water. Cats, man. After dealing with that mess, it's bedtime. I'm thankful I felt much better today than I did on Monday and Tuesday. Daily Total: $0 Day Seven 9 a.m. — Reluctantly get out of bed at the last possible minute after snoozing my alarm several times. Clearly I'm not a morning person, so I'm glad my job has relatively flexible hours. I'm excited to see that it's overcast today! Cloudy days aren't super common in Phoenix, but they remind me of home, so I don't mind them. I get ready, scarf down another blueberry muffin, and leave for work around 9:30. 10 a.m. — My coworker is swamped with work on a project and needs my help. It turns out to be pretty easy, and when it's done, I drop the results off at my coworker's office. 1 p.m. — I head over to my office building to meet with my boss. One meeting turns into two, which turns into three. She has a ton of students working on projects, and she'll be traveling a lot soon, so I'm taking over those meetings for her while she's gone. 4 p.m. — I go straight back to the lab after my meetings end. I check on the results of my project — two came out decently, one didn't. I'll come back in the morning to finish up. 5:30 p.m. — Head home. I'm absolutely starving, because with all my unexpected meetings I never got to eat lunch. It was super tempting to pick up food on the way, but I successfully gave myself the “we have food at home” talk. Instead, I reheat the leftover chickpeas from yesterday, poach two eggs, and eat while watching MasterChef. 10:30 p.m. — It's Valentine's Day and I haven't eaten chocolate yet, which I'm pretty sure is illegal. I make a brownie-in-a-mug recipe that I saw today — it doesn't really taste like a brownie, but it's warm and chocolatey, so I'm not mad. The sugar gives me a little burst of energy to start making a grocery list for tomorrow. I don't get far — I can never figure out what I want to eat! 12 a.m. — Early and busy day tomorrow! Same routine as always — meds, skincare, bed.

            "\t Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar. Today, as part of Your Spending In Your State: a freelance graphic designer who makes about $18,000 per year and spends some of her paycheck this week on Juanita's tortilla chips. Occupation: Freelance Graphic DesignerIndustry: DesignAge: 29Location: Missoula, MTSalary: ~$18,000Paycheck: ~$1,500 a month, pre-tax (varies, paid per project) Monthly ExpensesRent: $850, split with boyfriendStudent Loan Payments: $0. (My wonderful parents paid my in-state college tuition.)Health Insurance: $212Internet: $55Cell Phone: $0. (Mom is still paying for now. Bless her.)Electricity: $100Spotify: $10.79Netflix: $0. (I use my mom's account.)Dropbox: $99Car Insurance: $116 for our two cars. (Our van is still insured for Philadelphia, which makes it double the cost of our truck!)Climbing Gym Membership: $0. (Boyfriend pays.) Day One 8:30 a.m. — My boyfriend always gets up before me, which always wakes me up. I love it though: I get to roll around and scroll through the news and Instagram for a bit. It's Saturday so he's not working today. He makes us bacon, egg, and cheeses on everything bagels (which he made from scratch!) with arugula on the side. We watch The Daily Show while we eat on the couch; Ricky Martin is the guest and I didn't expect him to be super interesting but he has amazing energy that is actually lovely. 11 a.m. — I'm getting my period in a week, so this is always a hard time of the month for me emotionally, plus I'm stressed about a project I have. I almost want to go cry in bed but I know I'll feel way better if I work out, so I go to the climbing gym with my BF. He's paying for my membership fee as a sort of birthday present. (It's his way of trying to convince me to get back into climbing.) I climb a 5.10b-rated route that was really hard for me the other day, and today it comes more easily to me. I'm so stoked about the progress I'm making! It's my birthday tomorrow and crushing this route was a goal for me. 2 p.m. — Back home, we drink smoothies and eat leftover meatballs in a marsala cream sauce I made late last night. I also sneak in the last piece of leftover pizza while BF is outside spreading salt on our icy sidewalk. I've been joking forever that all I want for my birthday is Papa John's pizza because BF thinks it's so gross (and it is), but he finally let it happen the other day in a fit of hunger. He's the best. We hang out and nap before going out tonight. 6 p.m. — We Uber downtown to go to a cool distillery for cocktails before dinner. BF has a whiskey sour and I have gin with grapefruit, basil, honey, and probably some other stuff. We have a hilarious and awkward encounter when a larger group at a two-top table sizes up the spots around us at the communal table and we end up switching places with them. They offer to pay for our drinks but we politely decline. BF is paying anyway since it's my birthday celebration. I pay for the Uber though. $9.66 7 p.m. — Fine dining opportunities are limited here in Montana but we pick a place that at least has white tablecloths and looks decent. We enjoy the bread, soup, and salad courses, but we're underwhelmed by our entrées. My short rib is practically swimming in the red wine reduction and I can't even see my mashed potatoes! We get chocolate cake for dessert and it's pretty good. BF gets the Uber home. 9:30 p.m. — Our landlord's cat is waiting outside our house, so we let her in and pet her for a while. We can't have pets in our place, but we love to be with animals every chance we get. I wash my face, use my favorite Glossier serum, and watch bad TV in bed for an hour. (The Four is so stupid. They all sound and look like rejects from The Voice.) Daily Total: $9.66 Day Two 9:30 a.m. — Happy birthday to me! I wake up to a few texts from friends and family. I didn't sleep great, so BF brings me tea and a buttered bagel in bed and I watch SNL clips from last night. 11 a.m. — It's nice outside, so we go for a walk and talk about our plans for this year. We are moving in May, and I might be going to Europe then also, so the logistics are nagging at me. 12 p.m. — I browse Craigslist for apartments and then end up on Brandless, where I buy organic cotton rounds, two packs of organic beef jerky, shave gel, and maple cinnamon twisty things. Shipping is $1 since it's my first order with them (and I'm a sucker for a promo code). I look at ladles on Amazon but can't make up my mind. I'm very particular about my kitchen things being good quality. $16 2 p.m. — We're watching football playoffs today. BF makes pizza dough and then we make a pie with garlic cream sauce, sausage, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and arugula — my favorite! Except we forgot to make mozzarella. (My BF makes mozzarella at home. He's such a crazy weirdo, I love it.) So we make a plain one with olive oil, salt, and red pepper flakes. 3:30 p.m. — The Patriots are winning so we're cranky. I spot the landlord's cat when I'm taking out the trash, so we get some awesome cat therapy snuggles for a bit. 4 p.m. — I want to make cookies but we don't have enough butter so I walk to the corner store and get unsalted butter, eggs, and two bags of Juanita's Sweet Chili chips. Important side note: Juanita's are the best tortilla chips. (I've only seen them out West.) The flavored ones are what Dorito's should be. $14.19 5:30 p.m. — We watch the second playoff game and have cookies for dinner! We put a votive on top of one and BF sings a little \"Happy Birthday\" because I tell him to. I make a wish. 9 p.m. — Birds win! Not my wish but super awesome! BF is from the Philadelphia area so he's stoked his team is going to the Super Bowl. We met in Philly, so it's a second or third home for me, too. We head to bed early. Daily Total: $30.19 Day Three 9 a.m. — BF works east coast hours so I hear him on a conference call when I wake up. We both work from home, which probably isn't ideal. (I work in bed and he gets the table.) We're still figuring out what we want to do long-term since we recently took a break to travel in a van we converted for about a year and a half. It's tricky at times to have an unconventional life, but we love the freedom. 10:30 a.m. — I make us smoothies with pineapple, frozen mangoes, strawberries, spinach, yogurt, milk, and juice, and cut up a kiwi to go on the side. It's a tropical morning inside while it snows outside! 1 p.m. — I've been struggling to come up with concepts for my current client. They've given me free reign, which is a good problem to have, but it makes it so hard for me to narrow down ideas. BF brings me little ham sandwiches on ciabatta he made (have I mentioned he's crazy and amazing?) and a LaCroix because he knows I'm cranky. 3 p.m. — Best part of my flexible work schedule: I can go to the grocery store during off hours! I get bananas, cilantro, cherry tomatoes, paper towels, vanilla extract, cheddar cheese, local organic butter, local flour, and local sliced bread. $42.31 4 p.m. — Score! Birthday cards from my best friend from back home and my mom, who gives me $250 without fail every birthday and Hanukkah. And packages arrived while I was out: a mid-thigh-length down coat from L.L.Bean that went on sale after I first ordered it. (I ordered it again and will return the first one, saving me $60!) I also got a throw pillow and a pack of cloth napkins from Target. We used to use paper towels with our meals and I'm so excited to switch to reusable napkins. 5:30 p.m. — BF is taking a nap so I start marinating chicken for dinner and make a yogurt sauce. I also set up the recurring payments on my health insurance for the year – one major downside of the freelance life. I'm very lucky that my family has been investing money for me all my life, but it does move me into a higher tax bracket. (Ergo, no subsidies on my health insurance and I have a crazy-high deductible.) Thankfully, I don't really use my insurance much. I got an IUD a couple years ago so I have no prescriptions. 6 p.m. — After BF gets up, I work out to a Yoga With Adriene video. Lots of repetitive vinyasas. Her videos always hit the spot. Then I cook the chicken, make rice, and chop up toppings for one of our favorite dinners: street cart chicken! As former East Coasters, it's a dish we're nostalgic for here in Montana where the ethnic food is limited. We use a recipe from the latest Smitten Kitchen cookbook and for once we manage to save a little for tomorrow. 7:30 p.m. — We hang out on the couch and look at houses and floor plans on Pinterest. We bought a piece of land last fall and hope to be able to build a house on it someday. For now it's just a field, but we'll hopefully plant a big garden there this spring. BF made early investments in Bitcoin and Ether, so he spends a lot of time tracking the charts since they're so volatile. We hope to make good use of his gains for our future. 9 p.m. — I'm super excited for season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. When I try to set a recording, I realize I never watched the season 2 reunion. There goes my night. Daily Total: $42.31 Day Four 9 a.m. — I drink mint tea in bed while BF makes us breakfast: bacon, fried eggs, arugula, and sesame-encrusted bread he baked early this morning. We're so lucky to live like this. Granted I'm not saving right now, but I'll get there. I dive into last night's Bachelor. So gross but I can't help myself. 11 a.m. — I smell another lazy day; I end up focusing more on my background TV than the work at hand, I can't seem to dig into this project. Maybe I should go to a coffee shop one of these days. 1 p.m. — I heat up my leftovers and make BF a sandwich since he's stuck on a call. 4 p.m. — Finally picked a ladle I like on Amazon, and get a new dishwashing brush, too. The brush is $10, which seems kind of ridiculous, but it's made of natural materials. I'm trying to minimize our use of plastic, so it's worth the extra money to me. I just wish I didn't have to order it online because I know they'll throw plastic filler in the box they ship it in, but the store doesn't have all-wood brushes. $19.98 5 p.m. — We have smoothies before we go to the climbing gym with apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, frozen mangoes and strawberries, milk, yogurt, juice, and a sprinkle of bee pollen. I have no idea what the pollen does but we've had it sitting around, so what the heck. 5:30 p.m. — We met friends at the climbing gym, which was nice but meant we stayed a little longer than normal. I did climb a 5.10c route, though, so that was cool! I need to get stronger so I'm not exhausted after just a few routes. 8 p.m. — I whip up a Thai noodle dish (pad see ew, which I get at literally every Thai restaurant I go to) in a sweet soy sauce with bok choi, broccoli, and carrot. We wolf it down on the couch watching Black-ish, have cookies and milk for dessert, and pet the landlord's cat for a bit before bed. Daily Total: $19.98 Day Five 9 a.m. — One of those mornings where I feel dead asleep like a rock but also very aware of what I'm dreaming about. BF pops in to wake me up for real. We're hopefully going snowboarding today after he does a few hours of work. This will be our second attempt this winter: Since we officially live in Montana now, we're trying to take advantage of all the outdoors things, and all our friends snowboard. The first lesson was brutal and I pray this time won't be as rough. 9:30 a.m. — I force down Cold-Eeze gummies because I woke up feeling a little sick. BF brings me tea to huff over while he makes breakfast. He probably does more than his fair share since I'm a bit of a princess, but I think it all shakes out sort of evenly because I do a lot to keep the house running, like making sure all our bills are paid and doing laundry. I want to stay in bed and watch figure skating videos (they always make me feel better and I'm looking forward to the Olympics) but I drag myself out to the couch so we can eat together. The plate of migas he gives me makes my stomach turn a little, but I still eat most of it hoping it will make me feel better while we watch The Daily Show. 11 a.m. — I can't make up my mind about whether we should go snowboard, but we're supposed to go to Big Sky in a couple of weeks with friends and I hope to be able to do some of the easiest runs when we're there. We suit up and I put on a thick layer of face moisturizer to prep for the outdoors. 11:30 a.m. — We get gas and start the half hour drive up to the hill. It's awesome to have all this great, inexpensive recreation nearby! It's been pretty warm so the road is wet and dirty and our car gets covered in a layer of grime. I kind of love it. Shows we've been out there! $47.76 12 p.m. — Our snowboard practice costs $21 each (I pay for us both), including the rope tow on the bunny hill. I'm still not as good as I'd like to be, and I know I should cut myself some slack, but I can't help but compare myself to my BF curving down the hill effortlessly. I'm sending up huge sprays of snow as I bail out of heel-edge turns. This shit is terrifying and I don't know how I'll manage on a real run with other people zooming around. A posse of little kids learning to ski on the bunny hill rolls around adorably in the snow. $42 2 p.m. — Despite my struggles (and one breakdown because I cry when I'm frustrated), it was a great afternoon. We stop at a deli I've been wanting to try and get an Italian sandwich, a turkey pesto one, a pickle from the barrel, and a blood orange San Pellegrino. Turns out the slaw on the Italian is mayo-based and BF won't touch it, but that's okay with me. $25.20 3 p.m. — I vent to BF about my current project a little. He tries to help but he's an engineer, so talking about design with him can be frustrating. I reply to an email from my client and try to slip in some of my issues. Hopefully she doesn't think I'm being a total pain in the ass! 4 p.m. — Lazy afternoon; BF takes a nap and I get into those skating videos. I tell myself I'm getting better at judging the performances but there are tons of people in the YouTube comments with insane knowledge so I just read what they say and pretend I thought it too. It's really fun seeing the ladies I watched in the Olympics from 1998-2006 when I was into ice skating. I remember all the outfits and Michelle Kwan's Chinese dragon necklace that I totally copied in middle school. #Fangirl. 7 p.m. — I watch Fixer Upper with my BF. They work on a tiny cabin, which is right up our alley. Then I catch the second episode of The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. It feels like all other Ryan Murphy stuff in that I kind of hate it but I keep watching until I lose interest or something better comes along. 10 p.m. — I put on a charcoal mask because I feel a zit brewing on my cheek and get in bed, focusing in on a crossword puzzle. Daily Total: $114.96 Day Six 9:30 a.m. — Wake up with a sore neck – I must've fallen harder than I realized yesterday. We have one bagel left so BF makes a bacon, egg, and cheese and we each eat half. 12 p.m. — I want to get out to see if working somewhere else can help me focus better, but I know the café at the grocery store will be super busy right now. I decide to wait it out and make a smoothie with milk, juice, yogurt, apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, bee pollen, and frozen blueberries. It's kind of a weird mixture but comes out in a pretty color! I watch Riverdale while I wait for the lunch rush to ease up but then end up just walking to a coffee shop nearby. We don't really need much from the store anyway. 1:30 p.m. — Wow, this coffee shop is actually kind of cool. Go, Montana! It's also kind of tiny so I'm at the cramped bar with my cappuccino, but I manage to make good progress on this project. $3 3 p.m. — I hit a wall and buy a cardamom snickerdoodle cookie to help me along. It's pretty good but I only last 20 more minutes. $5.25 4 p.m. — BF baked ciabatta while I was gone. I truly live Oprah's bread dream. We snack and catch up — and my latest Glossier purchase arrives! I can't wait to cover my face in acid and also read and reread all the instructions and ingredients, probably while peeing. 5 p.m. — BF's dad and stepmom got us two Hello Fresh gift certificates for Christmas and our first box came yesterday; we're trying the first meal tonight. BF is most excited about the orange cashew chicken so I get the rice and sauce going. Before I finish, it's time for RuPaul's Drag Race. This is live TV, not a drill! 7 p.m. — The Hello Fresh was a really sweet gift idea and it's tasty, but the chicken has a funny texture. On TV, BenDeLaCreme comes with the shocking elimination selection! Even though I adore Aja, I've gotta give it up: DeLa definitely deserved to win this one. 9 p.m. — We're already getting ready for bed. We're such boring old people. I tried putting on my new face acid with toilet paper (still awaiting my new cotton rounds) and I get tons of little flakes of paper stuck to me. My face feels smooth though! BF helps me struggle with last night's crossword some more. He comes up with \"peekable\" for the clue, \"see-through.\" So groan-inducing. Daily Total: $8.25 Day Seven 6:45 a.m. — I can't get back to sleep after hearing BF get up. I dive into the RuPaul's Drag Race sub-Reddit. The fan theories and dirt on there is exceptional. 8:30 a.m. — Email from another client; I forgot this project would be starting so soon and I hope I can juggle both projects at once. This one is at least a recurring project I've been doing for a few years now, so I can kind of do it on autopilot if I want to. The style could really use a big refresh at this point but I don't know if I have the bandwidth to go there now. Maybe I'll devote time to inspiration and templating when things calm down with the larger project. 12 p.m. — I work on more concepts for the first client, and do that thing where you write an email, edit it a couple of times, look at something else for 10 minutes, and then hit send without looking at it. (Is that a thing?) She replies back quickly, very pleased. Holy farts, what a relief! We were thinking about going snowboarding again today because it's been snowing off and on the past couple days, but I feel like today might be better for working and running errands. (Even though the hill will be more crowded on the weekend.) 1 p.m. — I make mac and cheese with broccoli and ham and side salads. Turns out I was wrong about having a productive afternoon. Aunt Flo is here! 2 p.m. — Since I work at home, I make a point to go outside for just a little bit every day. I walk over to a UPS drop box to send my L.L.Bean coat back. I stop at CVS, too, to get a few boxes of tissues ($5), black nail polish (my favorite toe color — $3), and a mint Oreo candy bar ($1.22). It tastes like a crunchy Andes mint and I love it. As I walk up my street I see a deer cross the road, which is totally normal here. Sometimes I feel bad about being a transplant and inadvertently contributing to the growth and sprawl that is going on, but that's just the way it is I guess. $9.22 4 p.m. — Lie down with BF while he naps but I'm too wound up from my walk so I watch TV on my phone. I'm seriously craving carbs but BF talks me off the Domino's ledge and into spaghetti and meatballs. 5 p.m. — We watch The Good Place while we eat. We don't often watch shows together but we stumbled on this one and both really love it so it's nice to save it to watch together. 7 p.m. — I look at flights to Europe, and also home for a wedding this summer. It's so freaking expensive to fly anywhere from here, which kinda drives me nuts. I also really hate flying after two years of being able to drive everywhere in our van; there's nothing like being on the road and then being able to stop, make a nice lunch in the kitchen, and stretch your legs before continuing on your journey. I'm not making any decisions tonight, so my bank account is safe for now. 9 p.m. — I pop over to Backcountry.com to see if anything good is on sale. I've been monitoring prices on Ibex stuff since they're going out of business. Do I need a third wool shirt? Probably not, but I wear them almost every day in the fall and winter, so yes ($68). I also need snowboarding lenses for sunny days and find some that fit my frames on sale for $33. I ogle a Patagonia duffel in bright violet as well, which I'd love to have for Europe this spring, but I've been on a spending bender lately so I'm just going to add that to my wish list. $101 10:30 p.m. — Definitely time to get off the computer. I hope I'm feeling up to doing physical activity tomorrow, especially since I think BF is going to make another batch of bagels… Daily Total: $110.22 Money Diaries are meant to reflect individual women's experiences and do not necessarily reflect Refinery29's point of view.

            "\t President Donald Trump's top White House lawyer is raising concerns about the legal ramifications of the U.S. remaining in the Paris climate change agreement, according to sources familiar with the discussions — a development that could bode ill for the campaign by several top administration advisers to remain in the landmark accord.  White House counsel Don McGahn raised the concerns during a pair of closed-door meetings over the past week, the sources told POLITICO, although they added that he has not yet made a formal recommendation to the president and his stance isn't set in stone. Trump has said he plans to make a decision in the coming weeks, in what has become a symbolic debate about how far he will push his “America First” agenda despite potential blowback from U.S. allies.  Advocates for withdrawing the U.S. from the pact argue that its terms could somehow interfere with Trump's plans to roll back the Obama administration's domestic climate regulations — even though State Department lawyers strongly argue that's not the case.  Trump’s team remains divided over the Paris deal, even after a Thursday meeting of Cabinet secretaries and other advisers and a Monday meeting of administration lawyers. Trump officials could not reach consensus at either meeting, sources said.  The 2015 agreement, which won the backing of 195 nations, achieved a major policy goal of former President Barack Obama by getting countries around the world to make non-binding pledges to rein in their greenhouse gas emissions. Making the agreement legally binding could have required Obama to submit the deal to an extremely unlikely ratification in the Senate.  Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt support withdrawing, while other advisers, including Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, are said to support remaining.  Opponents of the Paris agreement have made a two-pronged legal case for withdrawing. The first, which Pruitt has raised in recent weeks, argues that staying in the Paris deal creates a legal opening for climate advocates to use the courts to challenge Trump’s efforts to undo Obama’s climate regulations for power plants. The second suggests that the terms of the Paris agreement don’t allow any country to reduce its emissions targets.  McGahn, sources said, raised both of those arguments during the Thursday meeting, and on Monday reiterated the concern that Paris could be cited in court challenges to Trump’s efforts to kill Obama’s climate rules. McGahn’s comments shocked State Department lawyers, who strongly reject both of those contentions, the sources said.  McGahn did not respond to requests for comment. A White House spokesman disputed POLITICO’s characterization of McGahn’s comments at the meeting, but did not specify what was inaccurate.  Hard-line conservatives are pressuring Trump to withdraw, noting that he promised to \"cancel\" the agreement during the campaign.  Pruitt first floated the idea of legal risk to the Obama administration's carbon rule for power plants in April. Several outside groups have published memos in recent weeks pushing back on Pruitt’s contention. Daniel Bodansky, an Arizona State University law professor who served as a State Department climate coordinator at the end of the Clinton administration, said that under common legal doctrine, a court would be unlikely to take the Paris deal into account on a challenge to a domestic policy.  Meanwhile, as news of the administration’s internal debate about the Paris deal spreads, environmental groups and supporters of the agreement have taken the unusual step of publicly defending the United States’ right to weaken its climate target. The Paris agreement was written to be non-binding, they argue. And while its intent was to enable countries to create more stringent carbon reductions, there's nothing in it to prevent backsliding.  The Sierra Club, which might otherwise be expected to challenge U.S. action to lower its commitments under Paris, indicated in a recent internal memo obtained by POLITICO that it likely wouldn’t win a court challenge.  “[I]t would be extremely difficult to prevail on the merits” if the group tried to sue the administration to prevent it from weakening its domestic climate change pledge or quickly withdrawing from the deal, the memo says.  In interviews with POLITICO, international diplomats said it was ridiculous to argue that countries can’t weaken their domestic climate plans, noting that the deal was specifically written to provide flexibility to countries at the request of the United States. Obama administration officials objected to efforts to insert legally binding language requiring countries to increase their ambition over time, officials familiar with the issue said.  Instead, the text says a country “may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” In the parlance of international negotiations, “may” suggests that countries have a choice. “Shall,” on the other hand, suggests a legal obligation.  European officials have had limited direct conversations with the White House over the Paris deal. But they have quietly tried to make the case that the benefits of remaining far outweigh the risks.  The officials, along with U.S. defenders of the Paris deal, worry that the international blowback of withdrawing is not getting enough attention from the White House.  “Legally and economically, the United States would be much more vulnerable outside of Paris than in,\" one European official told POLITICO. \"Being outside a major multilateral environmental agreement like the Paris agreement leaves a country more vulnerable to trade-related measures from countries that are inside the agreement.\"  The official added that there would be a \"very, very sharp expression of disappointment\" from Europe if the United States pulls out, adding that there would be political and diplomatic fallout that would be felt at the upcoming G-7 and G-20 meetings and for many years to come.  \"The U.S will once again by isolated and struggling against the pull of where the rest of the major economies want to move,\" the official said.  The administration could end up facing the kind of fierce criticism that President George W. Bush saw when he refused to back the Kyoto Protocol, even though the U.S. signed the agreement in 1998 when Bill Clinton was president.  Trump “will piss off every single country in the world” if he withdraws, said an international official who was closely involved in the negotiation over the text of the Paris deal. “It will haunt the administration in every aspect of its international diplomacy.”\n",
            "\t ...\n",
            "\t The Trump administration will file paperwork with the United Nations as early as Monday to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, marking the first formal step in a one-year process to exit the global pact to fight climate change. The move would leave the world's largest historic greenhouse gas emitter as the only country outside the accord, a decision President Donald Trump promised early in his term to unfetter America's domestic oil, gas and coal industries. \"What we won't do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,\" Trump said at a shale gas industry conference in Pennsylvania on Oct. 23, referring to his planned withdrawal from the agreement. The United States had signed onto the 2015 pact during the Obama administration, promising a 26-28% cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. Trump campaigned on a promise to rescind that pledge, saying it would unfairly hurt the U.S. economy while leaving other big polluters like China to increase emissions. But he was bound by U.N. rules to wait until Nov. 4, 2019 to file the exit papers. The State Department is expected to submit the letter to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, starting the clock on a process that would be completed just one day after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, on November 4, 2020. By Monday afternoon, no letter had been submitted. Officials for the White House and the State Department did not comment on when the paperwork would be filed. All of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls seeking to unseat Trump in next year's election have promised to re-engage the United States in the Paris Agreement if they win. But Trump's withdrawal from Paris could still leave a lasting mark, said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and former adviser to the U.S. climate envoy under President Barack Obama. \"While it serves the political needs of the Trump administration, we will lose a lot of traction with respect to U.S. influence globally,\" he said, adding it could take time for the international community \"to trust the U.S. as a consistent partner.\" Until its formal exit, the United States will continue to participate in negotiations over the technical aspects of the agreement, represented by a small team of career State Department officials. The United States and China, the world's two largest carbon emitters, have recently been leading negotiations of the Paris \"rule book\" that outlines transparency and reporting rules for signatories.\n",

            "\t The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an end to the Ebola epidemic, which killed more than 11,000 people across West Africa over the course of two years. The UN organization made the announcement at a press conference in Geneva on Thursday, marking 42 days since the last new Ebola case in Liberia, the last country affected by the virus. \"Today the World Health Organization declares the end of the most recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia and says all known chains of transmission have been stopped in West Africa,\" the WHO said. Ebola killed 4,809 people in Liberia, more than any other country. The country discharged its last two Ebola patients on December 3rd, though UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has warned that West Africa could see \"flare ups\" in the future. The WHO declared Liberia Ebola-free on two previous occasions, but the virus later resurfaced. \"There's no question that this disease got away from us.\" The Ebola outbreak began in December 2013 and soon grew into a global health crisis, infecting more than 28,000 people worldwide. Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and is characterized by severe fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and internal bleeding. The epidemic devastated communities in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, and exposed glaring holes in the global health community's emergency response systems. The WHO acknowledged those failures Thursday, saying the organization had learned from its mistakes. \"I think there's been general acknowledgment that WHO and the international community were slow at the start of this outbreak,\" Dr. Rick Brennan, WHO director of emergency response and humanitarian management, told reporters at today's briefing. \"There's no question that this disease got away from us, collectively,\" he said, adding that the WHO has since implemented reforms to be more responsive to future outbreaks.\n",

            "\t Fears worsened on Wednesday that the year-old Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo could spread to neighboring countries, as a boy in Uganda died from the disease and two of his close relatives there were infected. The boy, 5, from a Congolese family who had crossed into western Uganda on June 9, was the first confirmed case of Ebola outside the Democratic Republic of Congo since the highly infectious illness erupted last summer in the eastern part of the vast African country. Signaling his concern, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that he was convening a meeting of a group of outside expert advisers on Friday to assess whether the Ebola spread had become an international public health emergency. It will be the third such meeting on the Ebola outbreak by the group of experts, known as the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee. The W.H.O., which reported the first Uganda case on Tuesday, said on Wednesday that the afflicted child had died and that his 50-year-old grandmother and 3-year-old brother were confirmed to have tested positive for Ebola. The organization said that a hospital in a Uganda border town, Bwera, was treating them in isolation and that at least eight people may have been in contact with the first victim, raising the risk of further infections. “This first death, of a child, is a sickening reminder of the dangers of this disease,” said Brechtje van Lith, the Uganda director for Save the Children, an international charity. In a statement, the charity said that “governments, donors and agencies must act immediately to prevent further deaths.” On Thursday, a spokesman for Uganda’s Health Ministry, Emmanuel Ainebyoona, confirmed the death of the 50-year-old woman overnight, according to The Associated Press. Ebola, a viral disease that causes internal bleeding, is spread through bodily fluids of infected people and is extremely contagious. Infectious disease experts expressed alarm about Ebola’s spillover into Uganda, even though that country has long anticipated that possibility and administered a promising new vaccine to thousands of health workers, as have the health authorities in Congo. “The confirmation of new Ebola cases in Uganda is tragic but unfortunately not surprising,” Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, a London-based health research institution, said in a statement. “This epidemic is in a truly frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.” Some Ebola experts also expressed concern about the potential spread of Ebola to South Sudan, which like western Uganda also shares a porous border with the afflicted region of Congo. But unlike Uganda, South Sudan has been roiled by instability for years and is not considered well prepared to handle any possible outbreak. “South Sudan is a whole different ballgame,” Adrian Ouvry, humanitarian adviser at Mercy Corps, an international charity, said by phone from South Sudan, where he was on a working visit. “It is much less developed than Uganda or even the D.R.C.” The Congo outbreak is the second-deadliest on record, infecting more than 2,071 people and causing at least 1,396 deaths in the country as of June 10, according to the W.H.O. Its epicenter in a conflict zone has complicated efforts to contain the disease. Health workers, including doctors, have been attacked and killed, and some treatment centers have been destroyed. In April, the Islamic State claimed its first assault in the affected area. International health experts also have expressed worry about an acceleration in the number of Ebola infections. While it took about eight months to reach 1,000 cases, it has taken only a few months to surpass 2,000. The W.H.O.’s Emergency Committee has twice before concluded that the outbreak does not represent a global health threat, partly because it had not spread across borders. “Now that there is confirmed international spread, I think they have no choice but to make the declaration,” said Dr. Rebecca Katz, director of the Global Center for Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. Declaring the outbreak as such a health threat, known as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, would increase the level of attention that the W.H.O.’s member countries devote to combat it. After the committee’s most recent conclusion, in April, its chairman, Robert Steffen, said the experts were optimistic that the outbreak could be brought under control “within a foreseeable time.” The largest Ebola outbreak in history ravaged the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2014 to 2016, killing more than 11,300 people. The current outbreak is the most severe in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the disease was discovered there in 1976, when the country was known as Zaire. During that outbreak, the virus infected 318 people and killed 280 in an area near the Ebola River. In the United States, confirmation of the current outbreak’s spread into Uganda led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to announce new actions on Wednesday. The C.D.C., which has been providing health officials in Congo and the surrounding region with Ebola expertise, said it was activating an emergency operations center at its Atlanta headquarters that would provide “increased operational support for the response to meet the outbreak’s evolving challenges.” While the risk of a global spread “remains low,” the C.D.C. said in the announcement, it wanted to “ensure the response to this outbreak is robust and well-coordinated to stop the spread of disease and end the outbreak.”\n",

            "\t President Donald Trump asserted Friday that Republican plans to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law are “moving fast,” a counter to reports of division among Capitol Hill Republicans on the process.  Trump, noting that his pick for health and human services secretary, former Rep. Tom Price, had been confirmed, also took a dig at Democrats in an early-morning tweet, writing at about 5:15 a.m. that they had engineered “long delays” in confirming him. “Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast!” Trump said.  Republicans in Congress, who have long dreamed of dismantling Obamacare — Obama’s signature legislative achievement, formally known as the Affordable Care Act — but they remain divided on what they should put in its place if they repeal it. They are also facing resistance from constituents that has materialized in hostile town hall meetings back home. Trump surprised some Republicans when he demanded that they replace the law at about the same time that they repeal it. Some members of the GOP had hoped they could repeal the law with an included delay period, so that they could wait to come up with a solution.  White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, speaking on \"Fox and Friends\" Friday morning, said the White House team spent two hours with Price Thursday night discussing plans for Obamacare.  Price will \"quarterback our plans through the House and the Senate, and we're finalizing that hopefully during the first week of March. We'll be working on that plan with congressional leaders,\" Priebus said. \n",

            "\t Repealing and replacing Obamacare is going to be harder than Republicans think, the former Affordable Care Act implementation director told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Be careful what you wish for,\" Jay Angoff warned. But President-elect Donald Trump has a chance to lower health-care costs by using his dealmaking skills to \"drive hard bargains\" with drug companies, hospitals, doctors, medical equipment makers and insurers, Angoff said in a \"Squawk on the Street\" interview. \"One ray of hope for the Trump administration [is] … Donald Trump has been very good at … negotiating,\" he said, but stressed it's tough to negotiate on behalf of the government like one would negotiate in business. The major obstacles to getting rid of Obamacare are hospitals, doctors and even insurers, said Angoff, a former Missouri insurance commissioner, arguing they all like President Barack Obama's health-care law. \"Obamacare helps the hospitals get paid; helps the doctors get paid,\" he said. \"Even the insurers, who'd like to make certain changes to Obamacare, they still have a law which requires people to buy their product and subsidizes people for buying their product.\" Pressed on why insurers would want the ACA to continue when companies including Aetna, UnitedHealth and Humana are basically pulling out due to losses on the program, Angoff agreed that the law could be tweaked to make it more attractive for insurance companies. \"There's a way to make the system even better for insurers. Insurers can be permitted to sell skimpier coverage [and] to have more pricing freedom so that they can charge people more,\" he said. Another area that may present trouble for Trump, as it did Obama, is whether people who like their Obamacare coverage will get to keep it, said Angoff, who's currently at the Washington-based law firm Mehri & Skalet. Many people who wanted to keep their insurance prior to Obamacare were forced to make changes to comply with the coverage minimums of the new law. \"[Also] what happens to all those subsidies that Republicans have called bailouts, with some justification, under Obamacare? The insurers want to keep those subsidies,\" Angoff added.\n",

            "\t Washington (CNN)In the days since the FBI dropped a bombshell into the presidential race with the discovery of new emails relevant to the Hillary Clinton server investigation, bureau investigators worked \"around the clock\" to review the large volume of emails, two law enforcement officials told CNN. Key to the effort was software that was refined from its previous uses for the review of emails found on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.  \"A lot of this was a matter of technology,\" one official said. \"Without the technology, this would have taken a lot longer.\" The news that the FBI was confident in its July conclusion that there was not enough evidence to support criminal charges related to the server came in a letter from Comey to Congress on Sunday. That was the same way that Comey had initially thrown the presidential race into flux late last month, when he sent a letter to Congress saying newly discovered emails on Weiner's device, which came up in a separate investigation, were being looked at in relation to the Clinton investigation. Now, the probe is considered over with regard to Clinton.  FBI clears Clinton, again But with not all the emails deleted by her attorneys for being personal in nature recovered and not all the devices used to transmit the emails in the FBI's possession, it is possible something else could turn up that would require more review.  There were some classified emails found in the Abedin review, but the officials stressed the issue is not the classified information so much as proving intent. The sources would not specify how many of the classified emails were new or duplicates of ones already reviewed. Nor would officials say how many there were and what levels of classification they were at. Another source told CNN that none of the newly recovered emails were referred to other intelligence agencies to conduct a classification review. That suggests that none of them were considered a \"close call\" in terms of classification, the source said.   \"Keep in mind we are focused on intent,\" one official said. \"We know there are classified materials, but that doesn't change the conclusion reached back in July.\" The FBI team that conducted the email probe was reconstituted to handle the review of the new emails, which included some they hadn't previously seen in the yearlong probe of the server.  As for others who were part of the probe, including Abedin, the FBI is still working on some remaining aspects of the review, including determining how the emails ended up on the laptop in the first place. Abedin's attorneys have said she doesn't know why these emails were there because this wasn't a computer she used. The expectation remains that investigators will have to talk to Abedin again.  It is not uncommon to come across new evidence after concluding a probe -- which is what happened in October. Normally, investigators take a look to see if anything changes in their conclusions and it's not a controversial issue. This case isn't a normal case, given the election and the stakes.  Comey sent Sunday's letter to Congress as soon as possible, a senior law enforcement official said. The bureau chief was \"very careful\" about how the letter was crafted given the sensitivities. Attorney General Loretta Lynch was informed ahead of time that the FBI director was sending the updated letter to Congress, a Justice official told CNN on Sunday. Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with Comey's earlier decision to notify Congress last month. The attorney general backed Comey's move Sunday.  \"Everyone is on the same page,\" the senior law enforcement official said. Since there is no change to the original findings, the Justice Department has no need to weigh in further, the official added. \"The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously,\" the Justice Department said in a brief statement released Sunday afternoon. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t Under pressure from President Donald Trump, top Justice Department officials have agreed to review highly classified information with congressional leaders connected to the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The decision to share the information came after Trump met at the White House with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray and asked them to turn over to Congress and his own legal team all of the memos they have about an FBI informant who made contact with his 2016 campaign. The White House also acknowledged that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz would review allegations by Trump allies that the president's campaign was inappropriately surveilled in 2016, though Democrats and Justice Department defenders have called the allegations cynical attempts to undermine the ongoing probe of Trump campaign contacts with Russians. DOJ announced the new investigation on Sunday, and the White House affirmed it in a statement Monday afternoon. “Based on the meeting with the President, the Department of Justice has asked the Inspector General to expand its current investigation to include any irregularities with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s or the Department of Justice’s tactics concerning the Trump Campaign,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement after the meeting.  Sanders added that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will confer with national security leaders and Congress \"to review highly classified and other information they have requested.”  But the breadth of the agreement — and what information, exactly, might be provided — was not immediately clear. The Justice Department had previously indicated that sharing details about its informant could risk lives and endanger national security. It's also unclear who will be permitted to view the documents. The Justice Department typically shares its most sensitive information with the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" — the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, as well as the Republican and Democratic leaders of each chamber's Intelligence Committee. On his way back into Justice Department headquarters, Rosenstein declined to answer questions about the meeting. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said the documents requested by Trump will \"indicate what the informant found.\" He also said the memos \"should be made available to us on a confidential basis,\" he added. \"We should be at least allowed to read them so we know this exculpatory evidence is being preserved.” It's unclear if there were any arrangements made for the White House to view the documents. Trump’s lawyers also want to interview the FBI officials who made the decision to connect the informant with the campaign.  “It’s the FBI who has the onus for having invaded the campaign,” Giuliani said. Giuliani predicted the Justice Department would place redactions on some parts of the material.  “But as long as they turn over the vast majority of it, it gives you a real sense” of what the FBI was doing. “The question is, 'What are the justifications for it? Did the justifications continue? Did they pick up anything valuable?' That’s the most important thing to do. We think they didn’t.” It's unclear whether Rosenstein and Wray agreed to any disclosures that would breach long-standing DOJ precedent against revealing information about secret sources and ongoing investigations.  Justice Department officials have previously argued that such a disclosure to lawmakers would endanger national security and risk lives. But Republicans on Capitol Hill demanding the information have rejected that contention and accused Justice officials of stonewalling. The confrontation was, until Trump's involvement, defused after calls between the White House, DOJ officials and top lawmakers. On Sunday, Trump demanded that the Justice Department look into whether the FBI \"infiltrated or surveilled\" his campaign for political reasons. \"I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes — and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\" the president wrote on Twitter. Trump’s call for an investigation was met with eager support from some factions on Capitol Hill. “This is the right call from @realDonaldTrump--we've seen disturbing evidence that the FBI engaged in political targeting,” tweeted Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who has led the congressional calls to investigate DOJ over the Russia probe. “But the DOJ can't be trusted to investigate themselves--Congress needs the documents too. Rod Rosenstein: where are the documents? Show Americans the truth.” A group of 16 GOP lawmakers also prepared Monday to roll out a resolution to condemn FBI and DOJ officials for what they claim to be “misconduct” at the highest levels of the agencies. But law enforcement experts and intelligence-focused Democrats have countered that the use of informants is common in counterintelligence investigations. They warn that Trump and his allies in Congress are risking the erosion of years of trust that law enforcement has spent establishing trust with its informants. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described Monday's agreement as \"highly irregular and inappropriate\" and called on the White House to include Democrats in any meeting about the classified details \"in order to serve as a check on the disturbing tendency of the president’s allies to distort facts.\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Giuliani's remarks betrayed the true intentions of Trump's attempt to force details about the FBI informant into the open.  \"Giuliani removes all doubt — the White House effort to force DOJ to give investigatory materials to Congress is really about the defense team getting their hands on them,\" Schiff said. \"If the president is charged with a crime, he has a right to see the evidence. Not before.\" In anticipation of Trump’s order, the Justice Department has worked quickly to contain confrontation, preemptively announcing that the agency's inspector general would tack on Trump’s investigation request to his ongoing probe of potential surveillance abuse by the FBI — a probe that was launched based on previous demands by Trump allies. “That’s going to be released,\" Giuliani told POLITICO. \"It's already been circulated to people who have made significant comments. Everyone is anxiously awaiting it because it’s expected to be quite a knockout.” In an interview on Fox News, Vice President Mike Pence said the president was \"grateful\" for the inspector general probe. Giuliani, who is in Arizona on Monday and did not plan to be a part of the White House meeting, said he was unfazed by any potential fallout from the president upping the pressure on DOJ leaders. “Could you imagine why they’d say 'no'? I’m trying to figure that out,” Giuliani said. The Trump lawyer said one of his reasons for supporting the president's actions stemmed from several media outlets that have reported on the informant’s interactions with the Republican’s 2016 campaign, including a New York Times story last week about the first incarnations of the Russia investigation — dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane” — in the thick of the White House race.  He also singled out the Wall Street Journal, which on Sunday named the informant.  “It doesn’t trouble me that the president of the United States thinks that his Justice Department was acting inappropriately if they didn’t release to Congress information about what was done without identifying sources,” Giuliani said. “This can’t be earth-shattering, end-of-the-republic information. What would happen that’d be ugly?” Several high-profile former Justice Department officials have taken the exact opposite stance. Former Attorney General Eric Holder on Twitter Monday challenged the president over his foray into the details of the underlying Russia probe.  “Trump demand for DOJ investigation is dangerous/democracy threatening,\" the former Obama appointee wrote. \"DOJ response is disappointing. There is no basis/no predicate for an inquiry. It's time to stand for time honored DOJ independence. That separation from White House is a critical part of our system.\" Andrew Restuccia and Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t Investors shouldn't worry about what a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump could mean for his current term or even his reelection chances, Wall Street investment banks advised clients. But what they really should be worried about, Washington policy analysts said, is what the impeachment inquiry means for a potential trade deal with China and an already agreed-upon deal with Canada and Mexico. Investors also can forget about any new legislation like a drug prescription policy, they said. Several brokerages rushed to assure clients on Tuesday and Wednesday that while it's unlikely the Republican Senate will ever convict the president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to move forward with the impeachment inquiry could mire several of Trump's key trade initiatives, including the passage of the USMCA and talks with Beijing. Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday as a growing number of Democrats concerned over the president's alleged abuses of power overwhelmed her initial reluctance. The most recent Democratic outcry comes amid accusations that the president tried to coerce Ukraine's president to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump released on Wednesday notes of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and stocks showed little reaction. The investigation endangers the ratification of the landmark United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the rehashed trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. \"Legislating is dead. As we previously said, impeachment will lead to Congress doing nothing except that which it must do by established deadlines (like funding the government),\" wrote Raymond James policy analysts Ed Mills and Chris Meekins. \"The idea of bipartisan action on drug pricing, infrastructure, and potentially the passage of the USMCA (the new NAFTA) are dead until after the 2020 election,\" Mills and Meekins continued.  The U.S. sent about $300 billion in goods to Canada last year, more than to any other country, and about $265 billion in products to Mexico, its second-largest market. But the impeachment inquiry, at the very least, complicates that timeline, according to Dan Clifton of Strategas Research Partners. \"In the short run, it means it's unlikely that NAFTA's going to get through,\" Clifton said Wednesday on CNBC, referring to the USMCA. \"If you remember last week, Nancy Pelosi went on Jim Cramer's show, saying that she wanted to get the 'yes' on NAFTA. That's probably going to move away.\" The legislation, shortened to USMCA and pitched as a replacement to NAFTA, is one of the administration's major economic achievements. The accord makes changes to the trade relationships between the U.S. and its two largest trading partners, including stricter rules on the country of origin for auto parts and better enforcement of wage rules. One of Trump's top trade advisors, Peter Navarro, told CNBC earlier this month that the deal is so important that he was 100% sure Congress would ratify it this year. That seemed even more likely as recently as last week, when Pelosi told CNBC's Cramer that Democrats \"hope that we're on a path to yes\" on approving the USMCA. Wall Street also turned its attention to the odds of a U.S.-China trade deal in light of the new impeachment debate. The entrenched trade war between the Washington and Beijing remains one of the market's major headwinds both due to the imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods as well as the uncertainty felt by CEOs trying to protect supply chains and other infrastructure. Despite persistent calls from Wall Street to settle for partial concessions, the White House has toed the line on demands for a comprehensive agreement, complete with remedies for alleged intellectual property theft. \"From a China trade perspective, the debate will be about a Trump pivot towards a win via a 'mini deal' or doubling down to cater to his base,\" Raymond James' Meekins and Mills wrote. \"Trump doubled down in his criticism of China in his speech before the UN ... and did not sound like someone on the verge of a 'mini deal,'\" they added. \"However, the path forward remains very uncertain. We have repeatedly seen President Trump turn towards positive developments in trade disputes at times of political and stock market uncertainty.\" Though the two nations appeared to be close to a deal in the spring, negotiations broke down after China reneged on certain promises, according to U.S. trade officials. As the dispute intensified, the U.S. placed Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei on a blacklist that barred the company from purchasing parts from American suppliers. Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. and Japan had reached a limited trade deal as they push for a broader agreement. The first stage of the deal will open markets up to $7 billion in U.S. products, the president said while meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the U.N. in New York. Retaliatory responses by China against U.S. farmers sent American soybean exports to China tumbling, with total shipments to the Asian economic giant expected to end this marketing year some two-thirds lower, according to industry experts. \"On the one hand, the inquiry could fortify President Trump's trade stance as he tends to retrench and redirect when attacked. On the other hand, the inquiry could cause the president to look for victories beyond the water's edge to bolster his case for reelection,\" wrote Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky. \"We continue to believe that a de facto detente will materialize by the end of the year as we view the December tranche of tariffs on Chinese consumer goods as a motivator.\" But in terms of how the impeachment inquiry will affect Trump's tenure in the White House, or even of reelection, remains a matter of debate. Some, including Strategas' Clifton and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington researcher Brian Gardner, argue that opening an impeachment query poses a significant risk not to Trump, but to Democrats up for election in 2020. When \"the Republicans chose to impeach Bill Clinton, they were headed for a 40-seat win in that midterm election and the Democrats ended up winning five seats,\" Clifton recalled. \"So impeachment actually hurt the Republicans 20 years ago and that's the risk the Democrats are taking by entering this fight.\" Gardner noted Trump's uncanny ability to leverage political drama and said the recent news likely hurts Biden's odds of securing the Democratic presidential nomination. \"Mr. Trump has a unique ability to manipulate these kinds of situations to his advantage and if the House moves to impeach him we think it could backfire on Democrats and help Mr. Trump's reelection prospects. Democrats could easily overplay their hand and create a backlash that will unite Republicans,\" Gardner wrote. Correction: A summary misstated the day of Pelosi's announcement. It was Tuesday. — With reporting by CNBC's Michael Bloom.\n",

But Rosenstein’s stint — including his role in the firing of former FBI Director James ComeyJames Brien Comey3 real problems Republicans need to address to win in 2020 Barr predicts progressive prosecutors will lead to 'more crime, more victims' James Comey shows our criminal justice system works as intended MORE and subsequent oversight of the Mueller probe — quickly elevated the position’s status, meaning Rosen is likely to face more scrutiny than previous nominees. Rosen, a Transportation Department official who lacks experience as a prosecutor, told senators that if confirmed he would follow DOJ guidelines, including adhering to an Obama-era memo that outlined how the White House and senior Justice Department officials can communicate about ongoing investigations. “I’m not at the department, I’m not yet in a position to make a pronouncement about it,” Rosen told Sen.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) went further in his questioning, demanding that Rosen commit to making sure Mueller’s report — currently being processed by the DOJ — is released in its entirety to Congress. Rosen declined to make that promise, noting he is not yet a Justice Department employee and that Attorney General William BarrWilliam  Pelham BarrThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump searches for backstops amid recession worries Mueller report fades from political conversation Barr removes prisons chief after Epstein death MORE has ultimate authority at the agency. Blumenthal said he would not vote to advance Rosen out of committee unless the nominee committed to ensuring the report’s full release. “He’s given me no reason to have even a glimmer of confidence in his standing strong for the integrity and independence of the ongoing investigations regarding President Trump or any other individuals in power, and the transparency and disclosure of the Mueller report,” Blumenthal said after the hearing. Rosen is a deputy secretary at the Department of Transportation. He has worked as a general counsel at both Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget and spent nearly 30 years at the international law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where he was a senior partner. During the hearing, Rosen defended his lack of experience as a prosecutor by pointing to his lengthy career as a litigator. He said that if Barr were to recuse himself from any matters or had to step down, he felt confident he could fill the role of attorney general. If that situation arose, he said, he would turn to the “seasoned and experienced and highly capable prosecutors” at the department to help him carry out the duties of the nation’s top law enforcement job. “There are resources available and I would make it my job to utilize and leverage the expertise and experience they bring to bear, while combining that with my own experience and judgment to do the very best I could to serve in this position,” Rosen said. GOP senators at the hearing appeared generally supportive of Rosen, who fielded questions about alleged political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department. Rosen said that while he did not know all the facts of the situation, he would follow the conclusions reached by any investigations into any potential biases. “I don’t think we should have an attitude that anybody is above the law,” he said. But he did face some bipartisan pushback over the Justice Department’s implementation of the First Step Act, the criminal justice reform legislation that Trump signed into law last year. Lee, in particular, prodded Rosen over the agency’s adoption of the law. He pointed to DOJ missing the deadline to implement some provisions, and its decision to host a committee created by the act at the conservative Hudson Institute, which had criticized the criminal justice law, as evidence that the department wasn’t moving forward in good faith. Other Republicans didn’t appear concerned about the criminal justice efforts. “He said to me when we met and he reiterated, I think, this morning that he’s committed to implementing the law and all the laws,” freshman Sen.

            "\t HONG KONG — People in China are calling for a boycott of Apple products after tensions between China and the US reached new heights following fresh restrictions targeting Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Declaring a national emergency, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that banned US telecom companies from installing foreign equipment that poses a national security threat. A separate order bans Huawei from buying US technology without government approval. On Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, users reacted to US pressure on Huawei by rejecting Apple products. “The functions in Huawei are comparable to Apple iPhones or even better. We have such a good smartphone alternative, why are we still using Apple?” commented one user. Despite ongoing US pressure on the Chinese telecom giant — including indictments that accuse the company of stealing trade secrets and allegations that its phones provide a backdoor to the Chinese government for spying — Huawei is not losing support in China. “I feel guilty watching the trade war. Once I have money I will change my smartphone,” said another user who had typed the message from an iPhone. “I think Huawei’s branding is amazing, it chops an apple into eight pieces,” said another post, describing the company's spliced, red logo. Apple’s sales in China were already down 20% in the last quarter of 2018, according to an industry report. Meanwhile smartphone sales for Huawei were up nearly 25% in the same period. “We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a letter to investors in January, who added that much of the company’s revenue shortfall was due to lower sales in the country. Some Weibo users went farther and called for a rejection of other US technologies, too. “Trump doesn’t allow companies to use Huawei, then let's not use Apple. We shouldn’t buy any phone that uses Qualcomm as well,” the user wrote, referring to the US chipmaker based in San Diego. The move against Huawei comes only days after President Trump escalated the trade war, announcing increased tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods that went into effect last week. China fired back on Monday by announcing a 25% tariff of its own on $60 billion worth of American products that would go into effect June 1. Meanwhile, China announced Thursday formal espionage charges against two Canadians who were first detained last December after a senior Huawei executive was arrested in Canada at the request of US authorities. Their detention was seen as retaliatory, but China says they have been charged in accordance with the law. Customers look at iPhone products in an Apple store in Beijing last December. Apple has already relocated some of its production outside of China in response to the trade war, which has been in effect since last January. One of its manufacturers, Pegatron Corporation, said it would begin operations in April at a factory in Batam, a special economic zone within Indonesia that offers tax breaks, according to the Jakarta Post. Editorials in China Daily, a state-run media organization, have taken on a nationalist tenor in recent days in response, proclaiming the country would not bow to US pressure and that it was not afraid to fight back. Beijing “has consistently responded to Washington's attempts to turn the screws on it by each time giving it a sharp rap across the knuckles,” said one recent editorial. Chinese-language accounts on Twitter, displaying similar behavior patterns to bot accounts, also posted identical messages following the developments. “For the trade war initiated by the United States, China has long indicated its attitude: It is unwilling to fight, but it is not afraid to fight,” part of one thread read. Negotiations to resolve the trade war are currently at a standstill. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday he would travel to Beijing soon for more talks. “When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense,” President Trump tweeted earlier this week. On Weibo, different photos with a banner strung across restaurants and warning Americans of increased prices due to the trade war tariffs were being shared across the social media site. A few different versions of the banner popped up in social media posts. BuzzFeed News could not verify the veracity of the photos. An English version of the sign read: “From now on, our store will charge 25% service fee (tariff) to American customers. If you don’t understand, please consult the American Embassy!”\n",

            "\t US tech companies are reportedly sidestepping Trump’s Huawei ban. Chipmakers like Intel and Micron have reportedly found a workaround to the recent ban on US firms selling electronics to the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, according to New York Times sources. Since American suppliers often manufacture their products overseas, some of these products are not being classified as foreign-made in the transactions. As the Times’ Paul Mozur and Cecilia Kang write, “The deals underscore how difficult it is for the Trump administration to clamp down on companies that it considers a national security threat, like Huawei.” Reportedly, the Trump administration is aware of the sales but has yet to respond.[Paul Mozur and Cecilia Kang / The New York Times] The FTC and local government agencies announced their latest crackdown on robocallers. “Operation Call It Quits,” as it’s been called, went after nearly 100 companies and individuals in the past nine months. According to the FTC, tens of billions of robocalls are placed in the US every year. Some robocalling companies involved in the crackdown were specifically targeting senior citizens. These firms allegedly claimed to offer financial services such as lowering credit card interest rates as a ploy to get people to surrender their personal information. Such companies are now facing fines and legal challenges. “Today’s joint effort shows that combating this scourge remains a top priority for law enforcement agencies around the nation,” said Andrew Smith, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.[Zack Whittaker / TechCrunch] LinkedIn is moving away from general viral content. The professional social networking site announced on Wednesday it’s changing its Feed algorithm to surface posts that “cater to niche professional interests” as opposed to “elevating viral content,” according to Axios. The company has said that what helped motivate the change was internal research showing that the top 1 percent of power users attracted a disproportionate amount of attention on the platform. LinkedIn hopes the change will prompt users to engage with posts rather than scroll past them. It’s the latest example of a social media company tweaking how it surfaces content in an attempt to encourage better user behavior.[Sara Fischer / Axios] Apple acquired self-driving startup Drive.ai. The iPhone manufacturing giant told Axios it bought the company and is hiring dozens of Drive.ai engineers. Drive.ai, which makes equipment that can add self-driving capabilities to existing vehicles, was valued at $200 million two years ago. The companies did not disclose terms of the deal. Prior to news of the sale, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Drive.ai was closing its California office and laying off 90 workers. The acquisition is expected to help Apple develop its own self-driving technology.[Ina Fried and Kaveh Waddell / Axios]\n",

            "\t Washington (CNN)A top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee raised concerns Monday over reports that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn hid his discussions with Russian officials.  \"It would be very difficult for me to continue to rely on someone in such a vital position if I found out the person had not been truthful in describing his conversations with important foreign nationals prior to the appointment,\" Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN Monday. \"But it really isn't my call. That's going to be the president's call.\" President Donald Trump has expressed concerns with top aides about the amount of negative press Flynn has been getting, after reports that he discussed sanctions with Russian officials prior to Trump's inauguration and the chance that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his involvement. Democrats, meanwhile, have continued pressing on the exposed divide inside the Trump White House. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called on Trump to fire Flynn immediately. \"Michael Flynn's conduct was alarming enough before his secret communications with the Russians were exposed.  Now, we have a National Security Advisor who cannot be trusted not to put Putin before America,\" Pelosi said in a statement Monday.  Republicans in Congress are continuing work this week on a string of Trump Cabinet nominees and investigations from the House and Senate into allegations that Russia interfered with the election continue.  But Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the committee met last Thursday and reports of Flynn's communications with Russian officials did not come up then. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes downplayed any concerns about Flynn's job security, saying \"I think he is going to be just fine. I don't think he is going anywhere.\" Nunes then blasted the media and people inside the intelligence community for the stories about Flynn.  \"It's one of those Catch-22 situations: he's on the phone with the Russian ambassador -- which he ought to be on the phone with the Russian ambassador, that's a major country, we have big problems with them, it's natural that he would be talking to them,\" Nunes, a California Republican, said. He then mocked the media for its coverage, \"And for someone to leak out a partial transcript or a piece of it, where, you know 'Wow! This is a shocking thing where the Russian ambassador would bring up sanctions right in the middle of this when they're going on.' I don't think any of that is news.\" \n",

            "\t The Department of Justice voiced concerns about President Trump’s national security adviser and his talks with Russia’s ambassador late last month, according to a new report. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates feared that Michael Flynn was possibly vulnerable to Russian blackmail attempts, the Washington Post said Monday. The Post said Yates and a senior career national security official delivered a message to White House counsel Donald McGahn expressing concern about Flynn’s discussions with Russia’s ambassador. It is unclear what McGahn did with their warning. The communication from Yates was prompted by Flynn telling Vice President Mike PenceMichael (Mike) Richard PenceFEC chair calls on Trump to provide evidence of NH voter fraud Five years after Yazidi genocide, US warns ISIS is rebounding Log Cabin Republicans endorse Trump MORE and others he did not converse about U.S. sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak in December. The New York Times reported Monday night that Pence has told administration officials he believed Flynn lied to him and was angry that he defended Flynn and embarrassed by the information he withheld from the vice president.  One official told the Post all three officials believed Pence had a right to know Flynn had possibly misled him about his talks with Kislyak. Current and former officials told the Post they believed Flynn deceived the vice president, adding they could not rule out the possibility he acted with the knowledge of other transition officials.  The Times also noted the FBI has been examining Flynn’s phone calls, while the Army looks into whether he received money from the Russian government during a trip to Moscow in 2015. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan reportedly shared concerns about Flynn, the Post reported. The pair believed “Flynn had put himself in a compromising position” and agreed with Yates’ decision to warn the White House. Yates, who was then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn’s comments during an intercepted phone call with Kislyak last December “highly significant” and “potentially illegal.” An official familiar with Yates’ thinking told the Post she suspected Flynn may have violated the Logan Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another nation. Trump fired Yates last month, after she refused to have the DOJ defend his temporary ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations in court. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said Trump is “evaluating the situation” surrounding Flynn. Reports emerged last week Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions against Russia before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Current and former U.S. officials seemingly contradicted Pence and other administration officials who said Flynn never broached that topic with Kislyak.  Two U.S. officials told the Post on Feb. 9 that Flynn also led Kislyak to believe that the sanctions would be reevaluated once Trump took office. “Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” one official said. The Obama administration imposed fresh sanctions on Russia in December following revelations it tried helping Trump win the 2016 presidential race. View the discussion thread.

            "\t  (CNN)A federal investigation into whether Trump Organization executives violated campaign-finance laws appears to be wrapping up without charges being filed, according to people familiar with the matter.   For months, federal prosecutors in New York have examined whether company officials broke the law, including in their effort to reimburse Michael Cohen for hush-money payments he made to women alleging affairs with his former boss, President Donald Trump.  In recent weeks, however, their investigation has quieted, the people familiar with the inquiry said, and prosecutors now don't appear poised to charge any Trump Organization executives in the probe that stemmed from the case against Cohen.  A spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney's office declined to comment. An attorney for the Trump Organization declined to comment.  In January, one month after Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, prosecutors requested interviews with executives at the company, CNN reported. But prosecutors never followed up on their initial request, people familiar with the matter said, and the interviews never took place.  Meanwhile, there has been no contact between the Manhattan US Attorney's office and officials at the Trump Organization in more than five months, one person familiar with the matter said.   There is no indication that the case has been formally closed, and former federal prosecutors cautioned that it is always possible that new information could revive the inquiry. The Manhattan US Attorney's office continues to have at least one other ongoing Trump-connected investigation, a probe concerning the President's inaugural committee.  The Trump Organization investigation was launched out of the Cohen case, in which he pleaded guilty to eight counts, including two counts of campaign-finance violations for orchestrating or making payments during the 2016 election to two women -- adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who alleged affairs with Trump. (Trump has denied the allegations.)  RELATED: Michael Cohen's life behind bars After Cohen made the $130,000 payment to Daniels, he was reimbursed, prosecutors said in court filings, by the Trump Organization. The company's executives authorized payments to him totaling $420,000, in an effort to cover his original payment, tax liabilities and reward him with a bonus, according to prosecutors, and they falsely recorded those payments as legal expenses in their books.   The criminal inquiry centered on whether those payments, like the hush money Cohen gave to Daniels, violated campaign-finance law.  In late February, Cohen testified before Congress, implicating several Trump Organization executives whom he said knew about financial misstatements and were involved in reimbursing him for the hush-money scheme. He provided lawmakers with copies of signed checks from Donald Trump Jr., the President's son who is now executive vice president of the company, and Allen Weisselberg, Trump Org's chief financial officer. Weisselberg had received immunity to testify before a grand jury in the Cohen case.  There have been signs that prosecutors have continued to explore investigative threads tied to Cohen, who is currently serving a three-year prison term.  As recently as May, prosecutors asked a federal judge to allow them to keep certain information redacted in search warrant material from the Cohen case because of, as the judge put it in a court filing, \"ongoing aspects of the Government's investigation.\"   The judge granted that request and ordered prosecutors to file an update \"identifying the individuals or entities subject to any ongoing investigations and explaining any need for continued redaction,\" the deadline for which is Monday.  One reason why prosecutors might ask the court to keep the information under seal is because the portion of the search warrants relating to campaign finance may involve an individual or entity that connects with another active investigation, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor with the Manhattan US Attorney's office and a CNN contributor.  \"They have the ongoing investigation into the inauguration,\" he said. \"Maybe there is some unknown connection between those two investigations.\"  He added that there's no benefit in formally closing a case as long as the statute of limitations is still open.  \"The early closing of a case is not good because things happen in the future,\" Sandick said. \"There could be new reporting, a cooperator in another district, or a case that comes forward -- so why declare 'case over' and air all of your evidence when something else could happen in the future?\" \n",

            "\t President Donald Trump knew about Michael Cohen’s $130,000 payment to keep porn actress Stormy Daniels quiet about their alleged affair months before telling reporters he knew nothing about it in April, according to a report from the New York Times. Trump and the White House have repeatedly changed their stories on what happened; this week, Rudy Giuliani said Trump had repaid Cohen for the hush money — a new revelation. According to the Times report on Friday, it’s not clear exactly when Trump learned of the payment, which Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, made in October 2016. But he knew of it months before April, when he — if the Times’ reporting is right — lied to reporters aboard Air Force One, saying he had no knowledge of the payment. “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen is my attorney,” Trump said when asked Why Cohen had made the payment. “You’ll have to ask Michael.” Per the Times, Trump knew that Cohen had “succeeded” in keeping Daniels’ allegations from becoming public. Daniels, whose name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Cohen paid her $130,000 ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from speaking publicly about it. The Wall Street Journal reported the payout in January, after which Daniels and Trump’s representatives have been involved in a legal tug-of-war over her ability to speak publicly about her alleged relationship with the president. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement along with the payout, which she says now is invalid because Trump himself didn’t sign it. The battle is currently playing out in court. Since the Daniels payout became public in January, Trump and his aides have offered up varying accounts of what happened and what the president knew and when. Vox’s Jen Kirby recently laid out a timeline of how the situation has evolved, from Cohen in February telling the Times he paid Daniels with his own money, to Giuliani this week telling Sean Hannity that Trump had reimbursed Cohen. The former New York City mayor told the Times this week Trump repaid Cohen in installments of $35,000 a month through his “personal family account,” amounting to $460,000 or $470,000 total. That also ties Trump’s business, the Trump Organization, to the broader federal investigation into Cohen, whose office and home the FBI raided in April. Per the Times: Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has known since last year the details of how Mr. Cohen was being reimbursed, which was mainly through payments of $35,000 per month from the trust that contains the president’s personal fortune, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement. One person close to the Trump Organization said people with the company were aware that Mr. Cohen was still doing “legal work” for the president in 2017, but another person familiar with the situation said that Mr. Weisselberg did not know that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford when the retainer agreement was struck and when the payments went through. Mr. Weisselberg’s knowledge of the retainer agreement could draw Mr. Trump’s company deeper into the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen’s activities, increasing the president’s legal exposure in a wide-ranging case involving the lawyer often described as the president’s “fixer” in New York City. Trump and Giuliani have tried to walk back Giuliani’s comments this week. The former mayor released a written statement to “clarify” his remarks, saying that his “references to timing were not describing of the president’s knowledge.” Trump told reporters on Friday that Giuliani was just getting started in his job and would soon “get his facts straight.” But as more revelations come out about the Stormy Daniels matter, getting the facts straight is only going to be harder for the White House. When asked about Giuliani’s comments on Thursday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who in March said the president had “no knowledge of any payments,” said it’s something she’d rather not talk about. “I can’t get into the details of the ongoing litigation,” she said. “I’d refer you back to the president’s outside counsel.”\n",

            "\t As the Department of Justice goes after the AT&T-Time Warner merger, it has the odds in its favor, antitrust attorney David Goodfriend told CNBC on Monday. The DOJ sued on Monday to block AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner, calling it an \"illegal\" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation. Goodfriend said 29 of the last 30 times the Justice Department has brought this kind of injunctive claim, it has won the case. \"If you go on those odds, they wouldn't be bringing this case if they didn't feel pretty confident that they could prevail,\" he said in an interview with \"Closing Bell. \" In a statement on Monday, AT&T's general counsel, David McAtee, called the lawsuit a \"radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent.\" \"Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,\" he said. Craig Moffett, senior analyst and founder of MoffettNathanson, said the DOJ doesn't like the behavioral remedies \" that have been used in the past in so-called vertical mergers because it effectively has to make them be regulators. Vertical mergers are when two companies in separate positions in the same supply chain combine, in this case, content (Time Warner) and media distribution (AT&T). A Justice Department official told reporters on Monday that the merger would raise prices for consumers and potentially block creators of media content from distributing their product without paying more money. Moffett said about 70 percent of the country consumes Time Warner content through some platform other than A&T. \"As long as AT&T now becomes a supplier to its direct competitors, it has an incentive to raise the price to its direct competitors and that raises the price to those consumers. That's the argument,\" he said in an interview with \"Fast Money. \" Meanwhile, the elephant in the room is whether the Justice Department is acting more on politics than policy, Goodfriend said. President Donald Trump has had an adversarial relationship with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. The president has repeatedly called it \"fake news.\" Goodfriend said if the DOJ doesn't go after the Sinclair Broadcasting acquisition of Tribune Media, then it will be clear that politics was involved. \"If they go after that one with as much gusto as they've gone after this one, then I think we know we've got a new cop on the beat and they're serious about anti-trust enforcement,\" he said. — CNBC's John Melloy, Fred Imbert and Liz Moyer contributed to this report.\n",

            "\t WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - In a preview of arguments in the upcoming trial over AT&T’s deal to buy Time Warner Inc, government lawyers said on Tuesday it will raise prices for consumers while AT&T’s lawyer argued the company has no reason to withhold programming from competitors as feared. Opening arguments are expected Wednesday before Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if the Justice Department was correct to seek to block the $85 billion deal on the grounds that it would hurt cable television rivals and, by extension, their consumers. The government estimates that the deal would hike an average subscriber’s monthly cable bill by 45 cents. It filed its lawsuit in November. At a hearing to discuss how to handle sensitive business information in the trial, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli argued that it would be “catastrophic” for Time Warner to withhold programming in hopes that disgruntled customers would drop their cable company and sign up with AT&T’s DirecTV, as the government has alleged they could do. He argued that Time Warner would lose millions of dollars a month in fees and advertising, and that the few subscribers that DirecTV could gain would not make up the difference. Petrocelli also pointed to a voluntary commitment that AT&T made to distributors to refrain from withholding programming if there is an impasse in licensing talks. Twenty of its 1,000 distributors signed on. Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the government’s first two witnesses would discuss their companies’ negotiations in buying Time Warner content. He did not identify the witnesses. “What drives these customers to have concerns is that their negotiating partner (Time Warner) is being acquired by someone they compete with,” said Conrath. An official from Google’s YouTube will testify on the importance of Time Warner’s Turner family of stations, which includes CNN, to DirecTV’s rivals, a Justice Department lawyer said previously. AT&T’s Petrocelli also noted the role of big technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google in transforming how people watch television and, more to the point, winning away advertisers from the pay TV companies. “They are running away with the industry,” said Petrocelli, noting the internet companies’ skill at targeting ads to the right consumer. “Cable bills can’t go up any more because people won’t pay any more.” Conrath indicated that an expert on advertising, whom he did not identify, would testify on this issue. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes are also expected to testify during the trial, which the judge has said would last six to eight weeks. Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department’s decision to oppose the transaction. AT&T lawyers have said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing Trump’s statements that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.

Other countries have withheld their endorsement until new elections are held. Election officials said Maduro won the last election, though many organizations consider them illegitimate. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Saturday that they are not interested in removing or imposing governments because Spain \"believes in democracy and free elections in Venezuela.\" \"That said, if in eight days there are not free, transparent and democratic elections, Spain will recognize Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela.\" French President Emmanuel Macron followed in suit soon after, saying that \"the Venezuelan people should be able to freely decide their future.\" \"If elections are not announced in eight days, we could recognize Guaidó as the 'president in charge' of Venezuela to implement that political process. We will work jointly with out European allies.\" A spokeswoman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel tweeted Saturday that, “the people of Venezuela must be able to freely and securely decide about its future,” according to The Associated Press. The United Nations Security Council is set to meet later Saturday to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Maduro has accused Guaidó and countries backing him of staging a coup and violating Venezuela's sovereignty. View the discussion thread.

            "\t Washington (CNN)As the Trump administration touted the latest action in its campaign targeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his government condemned the move as \"economic terrorism against the Venezuelan people.\" On Monday night, President Donald Trump issued a sweeping executive order banning Americans from doing business with Maduro's government and freezing its assets and associated entities unless specifically exempted. It is the latest move in the US bid to force out the embattled Venezuelan leader, with whom the United States severed ties in January. The US and dozens of other countries have backed opposition leader Juan Guaido and have called on Maduro to leave power.  National security adviser John Bolton, speaking at a conference in Lima, Peru, on Tuesday, said the Maduro government was \"on notice\" following the executive order, calling it the most sweeping action the administration has taken over the last six months. He said the US had not taken such an action in the Western Hemisphere since 1988, when it froze the assets of the Noriega government in Panama.  Bolton warned against continued financial engagement with the Maduro government, saying, \"There is no need to risk your business interests with the United States for the purposes of profiting from a corrupt and dying regime.\" In a statement on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the executive order was not an embargo but \"a significant action\" taken \"in response to the continuing usurpation of power by Maduro and persons affiliated with him from the legitimate interim government of Interim President Guaido, as well as human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention of Venezuelan citizens, interference with freedom of expression, including for members of the media, and ongoing attempts to undermine Interim President Guaido and the democratically elected National Assembly's exercise of legitimate authority in Venezuela.\" The Maduro government denounced the executive order in a statement. \"This decision from the government in the United States attempts to award a legal form to the sanctions in all the assets and properties of the Venezuelan state, constituting the most grotesque and shameless sacking in international relation's modern history,\" the statement said. \"In the face of the imperialist attack, President Nicolas Maduro ratifies his call to unity for all Venezuelans to confront the economic and political terrorism in this new phase.\" Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations called the sanctions \"illegal, cruel, monstrous measures.\" In a letter, Venezuela also appealed to the UN Security Council on Tuesday to block what it says are US attempts to provoke a military incident and to set up a naval blockade.  The United Nations on Tuesday expressed concern about getting humanitarian aid to the people of Venezuela in the wake of the latest sanctions. The Trump administration has said there is an exception for humanitarian aid. Some experts have echoed the administration on the scope of the latest sanctions, although they noted that the action doesn't go so far as to impose a total economic embargo.  Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official and the senior director of the Center on Economic and Financial Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, noted that \"prior to executive order, there were restrictions on Venezuela entities, but they were sort of transactionally limited.\"  \"What you have now is full sanctions...on every government of Venezuela entity. So in that sense, it is a significant escalation,\" he told CNN. \"These newest sanctions are a way to, I think, much more comprehensively codify all of the various sanctions imposed thus far but also be much more explicit as far as blocking all property and assets that are under the control of the regime,\" said Jason Marczak, the director of the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. He told CNN he believes there will be \"a chilling effect with regard to any business interests or any business transactions in Venezuela.\" However, experts have suggested that the actual financial impact of the move may be limited given the administration's existing sanctions regime. \"I don't think this does much of anything because it only targets the government of Venezuela and US persons business with it. I can't believe there is much of that after the PDVSA sanctions of January so, practically, though this is a potentially big step legally, I can't see it having any real practical effect beyond the sanctions in place,\" Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who worked on sanctions policy, told CNN in an email. He explained that because the US and Venezuela do not have a normal relationship, the \"practical effects\" of the action are likely to be \"marginal at best.\" Lorber told CNN the economic impact \"probably won't be that significant.\"  \"Many US companies have already pulled out of Venezuela,\" he said. \"I think that the economic impact could be related to the threat against Chinese, Russian and Cuban entities.\" While the new executive order does not include secondary sanctions, Lorber notes that the provision in the executive order for material support could expose foreign companies to sanctions.  Marczak noted that \"there are already a number of measures that kind of adversely affect both Russia and China with regards to their dealings in Venezuela.\" In March, the US designated a Moscow-based bank for its support of Venezuelan oil and natural gas company PDVSA.

            "\t (Combines stories, adds German, Commission comment, background) By Jan Strupczewski and Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The euro zone cannot set the details of medium-term debt relief for Greece now because they will depend on what happens by 2018, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers said on Monday, as pressure grows on the bloc to take decisions this year. In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018, but left key details to be decided later - a compromise between Germany’s view that no immediate action was needed and the International Monetary Fund’s call for decisions now. “In May we said already there are a number of possible measures for the medium term and the extent to which they are necessary is impossible to determine right now,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem said before a meeting of the finance ministers. “It depends on what happens between now and the second half of 2018 in terms of economic growth, interest rates, inflation and of course the commitment from the Greek government,” he said. “So that kind of specific clarity of what is in the medium-term package is impossible to give and that was also understood by the IMF in May when we said we can only put a figure on it when we are in the second half of 2018,” he said. But Greece, the IMF and the European Commission are pushing for a more detailed declaration this year. They say that would improve investor confidence, encourage Greek growth and help Athens eventually return to market financing. The deadline for more details on medium-term debt relief has become December, because that is when the IMF staff is to recommend to its board whether the Fund should join the now purely euro zone bailout for Greece. The IMF believes that without substantial relief from the euro zone Greece’s debt is unsustainable. It does not want to commit to joining the bailout without knowing now how much the euro zone would be willing to ease the burden on Athens later. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in September that debt relief was key for the Greek economy to pick up. Without it, he warned, the country could be forced to ask for more help again and again. But Germany, which faces elections in late 2017 and where financial help for Greece is a controversial topic, is adamant no discussion on the details should take place now. Berlin believes that there is no rush, because grace periods the euro zone has granted to Athens mean Greece has almost no debt servicing until 2023. Greece can get short-term relief measures now, because it completed the first batch of reforms agreed with creditors, but nothing else, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. “We said everything in May. We would, after the first programme review, look at the short-term measures that the ESM could do,” he told reporters before the meeting. “That is undisputed and everything else would decided be after the ... programme, so in 2018... That does not need to be discussed further, but at the end and in the light of economic developments then. That is what the German Bundestag agreed to and not something else,” Schaeuble said. The short-term relief steps, for which Greece is eligible, include reducing interest rate risk and smoothing the repayment profile of loans under the previous bailout. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said that Greece was broadly on track to meet fiscal targets agreed with creditors. “... We see that they are likely to meet this year’s fiscal targets and also the preparations for next year’s budget show that the primary surplus target, as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding - 1.75 percent of GDP - is within reach,” Dombrovskis said. Dijsselbloem said euro zone ministers would return to the debt discussion at their next meeting on Dec. 5.

            "\t THESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - A rift between the International Monetary Fund and the European Union over how to make Greece’s debt sustainable is damaging the country’s attempts at economic recovery, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Sunday. Describing the debt pile, equivalent to more than 170 percent of economic output, as not just a Greek but a “European problem”, he said investors would remain wary of the country for as long as the two sides were at odds on how to restructure it. “I would say that what is creating conditions of delay in regaining trust of markets and investors ... is the constant clash and disagreement between the IMF and European institutions,” Tsipras told a news conference in the northern city of Thessaloniki. Greece almost tumbled out of the euro zone last year, with investors fleeing its assets as talks dragged on between Athens and international lenders over terms of a financial bailout, the country’s third since 2010. The IMF has yet to decide whether to participate in Greece’s newest international bailout, saying it is not yet convinced the country’s debt is sustainable or its fiscal targets feasible. Greece’s debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the euro zone. Tsipras said differing views among lenders was preventing the inclusion of Greek debt in the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) asset purchase program. The ECB has said it cannot specify when it could start buying Greek bonds, but that Greece needs to pass a debt sustainability analysis before it happens. [IDnF9N19F00B] Lenders have promised to look at how Greece’s debt mountain can be made sustainable, and whatever they decide will swing whether the IMF decides to sign up for the latest bailout deal. Tsipras, a leftist who came to power in early 2015 promising to end years of austerity, is trailing opposition New Democracy in opinion polls. A Kapa Research poll published by the To Vima newspaper on Saturday showed New Democracy ahead by 3.9 points. On Sunday, Tsipras ruled out early elections, saying: “The country doesn’t need elections. The country needs stability.” On Friday, euro zone finance ministers called on Greece to stay on track with reforms it must pursue under the bailout, which is worth up to 86 billion euros, ahead of a second review of progress in meeting terms that is due to start in October. It still needs to pursue energy market reforms, create a new body to oversee privatizations and establish a new independent revenue agency. The Greek premier said the country had already completed 70 percent of reforms required under the bailout program. Tsipras, who eschews ties and prefers open-collared shirts, reiterated a pledge that a “significant event”, such as debt relief, would make him put one on. “I never got married, so I couldn’t wear one at my wedding,” he joked. “I don’t have any hang-ups about it, but I made a commitment that I would make that wardrobe change when we have an important event.” Additional reporting by Renee Maltezou; Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Catherine Evans\n",

            " WUHAN, China — Weak with fever, An Jianhua waited in line for seven hours outside the hospital in the cold, hoping to get tested for the new coronavirus, which doctors suspected she had contracted. Ms. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An’s fever, but that was all. Since then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An’s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle. “I can’t let my mom die at home,” said her son, He Jun. “Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.” As countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone. Last month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat — or even diagnose — the coronavirus. Expressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals — if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases. Ambulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China’s equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue. Those who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families. Updated Feb. 26, 2020 Many doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak. On Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest. “The situation that we’ve seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,” Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus. Just steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car. “Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,” Mr. Long said. “In our neighborhood, many who weren’t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.” Getting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops. According to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million. Patients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus. But in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes “severe symptoms” has been set too high — so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead. Amy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu’s mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said. Without the test, her mother couldn’t be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children. “I’m very dissatisfied with the government,” Ms. Hu said. “It’s like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.” Tong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father’s cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus. But neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves. There was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents’ bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days. “All I want to do is take care of my parents,” Mr. Tong said. “I don’t even care if I get infected.” For some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough. Last month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said. The hospital classified the cause as “severe pneumonia,” Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus. On the day his father died, Mr. Gan began to show the same symptoms, he said. But without a car, he has not been able to go to one of the designated hospitals to get tested for the coronavirus. “Getting treatment is so difficult,” he whispered slowly by telephone from a small hospital near his home where he was being treated for viral pneumonia. “We can’t get admitted to the hospitals. And there’s not enough medicine.” Elsie Chen contributed reporting.\n",

            "\t (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates in order to offset growing risks to the economy, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said on Monday. “My message is clear: we should be supporting the economy, not tapping the brakes on the economy so I want to look at the data over the next few months but so far I am happy that we’re cutting interest rates,” Kashkari said during an event in Prior Lake, Minnesota. “How much more do we have to cut? I don’t know yet,” he said, citing slowing global growth, weakening business investment and inflation that is below the central bank’s 2% target as economic risk factors. Kashkari has repeatedly said he thinks the U.S. economy should have interest rates lower than the current level in order to draw more people back into work and push up wages. During his appearance, Kashkari repeated his belief that inflation has not been rising more quickly because there are still more workers that can be enticed back to work. Data from the Labor Department last Friday showed unemployment to be near a 50-year low at 3.5%. Asked about the potential for the Federal Reserve to have less room to stimulate the economy in the event of a recession owing to already low interest rates, Kashkari said quantitative easing, when the Fed buys bonds to boost market liquidity, could be used again as happened following the 2008 financial crisis. “I feel like we have more confidence now that if we needed to use (other tools) we would be able to use them maybe even more powerfully than we did in the past,” Kashkari said. The Fed is currently divided on the need to further lower borrowing costs. The benchmark overnight lending rate was lowered to a target range between 1.75% and 2.0% after a 7-3 vote in favor of the move at the central bank’s last meeting in September. The Federal Reserve next meets on Oct. 29-30 and investors currently expect a rate cut at that policy meeting. Kashkari does not currently have a vote on monetary policy but will next year as part of the Fed’s rotation system. Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n",

During Tuesday’s roll call, Ryan received 239 of the 241 possible Republican votes for Speaker, given that he didn’t vote. Pelosi got 189 votes, with four defections. Rep. Jim Cooper (Tenn.), one of the last conservative Blue Dog Democrats standing, and Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) cast their votes for Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi in the caucus vote in November. Rep.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) backed Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil-rights icon. The strong vote totals for Paul Ryan and Pelosi represented a remarkable turnaround for both House leaders. Just a few months ago, Republicans were privately whispering that Ryan’s days as Speaker might be numbered, after he told his GOP colleagues he could neither defend nor campaign with Trump after the nominee was caught on tape speaking disparagingly about women. But Ryan’s fate changed when Trump shocked the political world and won the election, then said he wanted Ryan to stay put to help implement his agenda on the Hill. Across the aisle, Pelosi was able to corral the overwhelming support of her caucus. The lopsided vote displayed the power of Pelosi to rally her members and highlighted Democrats' wish to form a united front in the face of the incoming Trump administration. Weeks earlier, Tim Ryan had challenged Pelosi for the top leadership spot, gaining support from a third of the caucus in a closed-door, secret ballot vote. But Tuesday's public tally was an early sign that the Democrats are ready to put that fight behind them for the sake of taking on Trump and defending President Obama's legislative legacy from the Republicans vowing to dismantle those same achievements. As he nominated Pelosi, Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York, the new Democratic Caucus chairman who briefly considered his own leadership challenge last year, lauded her as a political powerhouse who \"will never be outworked, outmaneuvered or out-smarted.\" He said a vote for Pelosi is \"a vote to ensure that Congress does not undo\" Obama's triumphs. \"We cannot turn back the clock,\" Crowley said. The Democrats listened. Even most of those who had publicly supported Ryan last month quickly jumped on board to back Pelosi, including Reps. Seth Moulton (Mass.), Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), Beto O'Rourke (Texas) and Alcee Hastings (Fla.). Pelosi's four defection were a stark improvement over the 19 she faced in 2011, after the Democrats lost 63 seats — and the House gavel. That GOP wave prompted former Rep. Heath Shuler (D-N.C.) to stage the only other challenge to Pelosi's 14-year reign atop the party.

The Speaker, who was the party's vice presidential nominee in 2012, has rejected some of Trump’s more extreme statements and positions: Ryan called Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration “unconstitutional,” blasted his attacks on a Mexican-American judge as “racist,” and chided the candidate for refusing to quickly disavow support from a white supremacist.

            "\t Photo: APThe Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed today that it has been unable to decrypt a phone belonging to the gunman who killed 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas—an announcement that is likely to start another battle between law enforcement and technology companies over encryption. The phone was flown to Quantico for examination, Christopher Combs, an FBI special agent who leads the San Antonio bureau, said at a press conference. But so far, the FBI has been unable to unlock it. The episode is reminiscent of the FBI’s legal fight with Apple last year, in which the agency sought to force Apple to decrypt an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Although the FBI had a warrant to search the phone, the agency could not because the device was encrypted. Apple argued that creating special software to unlock the phone would jeopardize the security of all its products. Eventually, the FBI paid another company $900,000 to crack the phone.Although the FBI was able to open the San Bernardino shooter’s phone, the incident is still a regular touchstone for law enforcement officials who argue that encryption is thwarting their ability to catch criminals. The FBI Can&apost Stop Fearmongering About EncryptionNever in the past century has the FBI ever had greater access to consumer data than it does today.…Read more ReadCombs raised that exact point during his press conference. “Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to get into that phone. So it actually highlights an issue that you’ve all heard about before with the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryptions, law enforcement whether it’s at the state, local, or the federal level is increasingly not able to get into these phones,” he said.Combs declined to say what kind of phone the Sutherland Springs shooter used. “I’m not going to describe what phone it is because I don’t want to tell every bad guy out there what phone to buy to harass our efforts on trying to find justice here,” he added.\n",

            "\t The Justice Department has managed to unlock an iPhone 5c used by the gunman Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last December. The high-profile case has pitted federal law enforcement agencies against Apple, which fought a legal order to work around its passcode security feature to give law enforcement access to the phone’s data. The FBI said it relied on a third party to crack the phone’s encrypted data, raising questions about iPhone security and whether federal agencies should disclose their method. But what if the device had been running Android? Would the same technical and legal drama have played out? We are Android users and researchers, and the first thing we did when the FBI-Apple dispute hit popular media was read Android’s Full Disk Encryption documentation. We attempted to replicate what the FBI had wanted to do on an Android phone and found some useful results. Beyond the fact the Android ecosystem involves more companies, we discovered some technical differences, including a way to remotely update and therefore unlock encryption keys, something the FBI was not able to do for the iPhone 5c on its own. Data encryption on smartphones involves a key that the phone creates by combining 1) a user’s unlock code, if any (often a four- to six-digit passcode), and 2) a long, complicated number specific to the individual device being used. Attackers can try to crack either the key directly — which is very hard — or combinations of the passcode and device-specific number, which is hidden and roughly equally difficult to guess. Decoding this strong encryption can be very difficult. But sometimes getting access to encrypted data from a phone doesn’t involve any code-breaking at all. Here’s how: A custom app could be installed on a target phone to extract information. In March 2011, Google remotely installed a program that cleaned up phones infected by malicious software. It is unclear if Android still allows this. Many applications use Android’s Backup API. The information that is backed up, and thereby accessible from the backup site directly, depends on which applications are installed on the phone. If the target data are stored on a removable SD card, it may be unencrypted. Only the most recent versions of Android allow the user to encrypt an entire removable SD card; not all apps encrypt data stored on an SD card. Some phones have fingerprint readers, which can be unlocked with an image of the phone owner’s fingerprint. Some people have modified their phones' operating systems to give them “root” privileges — access to the device’s data beyond what is allowed during normal operations — and potentially weakening security. A phone can be unlocked by trying every possible encryption key But if these options are not available, code-breaking is the remaining way in. In what is called a “brute force” attack, a phone can be unlocked by trying every possible encryption key (i.e., all character combinations possible) until the right one is reached and the device (or data) unlocks. There are two types of brute-force attacks: offline and online. In some ways an offline attack is easier — by copying the data off the device and onto a more powerful computer, specialized software and other techniques can be used to try all different passcode combinations. But offline attacks can also be much harder, because they require either trying every single possible encryption key, or figuring out the user’s passcode and the device-specific key (the unique ID on Apple, and the hardware-bound key on newer versions of Android). To try every potential solution to a fairly standard 128-bit AES key means trying all 100 undecillion (1038) potential solutions — enough to take a supercomputer more than a billion billion years. Guessing the passcode could be relatively quick: for a six-digit PIN with only numbers, that’s just a million options. If letters and special symbols like “$” and “#” are allowed, there would be more options, but still only in the hundreds of billions. However, guessing the device-specific key would likely be just as hard as guessing the encryption key. That leaves the online attack, which happens directly on the phone. With the device-specific key readily available to the operating system, this reduces the task to the much smaller burden of trying only all potential passcodes. However, the phone itself can be configured to resist online attacks. For example, the phone can insert a time delay between a failed passcode guess and allowing another attempt, or even delete the data after a certain number of failed attempts. Apple’s iOS has both of these capabilities, automatically introducing increasingly long delays after each failure, and, at a user’s option, wiping the device after 10 passcode failures. What happens when one tries to crack into a locked Android phone? Different manufacturers set up their Android devices differently; Nexus phones run Google’s standard Android configuration. We used a Nexus 4 device running stock Android 5.1.1 and full disk encryption enabled. Unlike the iPhone, the delays did not get longer with subsequent failures We started with a phone that was already running but had a locked screen. Android allows PINs, passwords and pattern-based locking, in which a user must connect a series of dots in the correct sequence to unlock the phone; we conducted this test with each type. We had manually assigned the actual passcode on the phone, but our unlocking attempts were randomly generated. After five failed passcode attempts, Android imposed a 30-second delay before allowing another try. Unlike the iPhone, the delays did not get longer with subsequent failures; over 40 attempts, we encountered only a 30-second delay after every five failures. The phone kept count of how many successive attempts had failed, but did wipe the data. (Android phones from other manufacturers may insert increasing delays similar to iOS.) These delays impose a significant time penalty on an attacker. Brute-forcing a six-digit PIN (one million combinations) could incur a worst-case delay of just more than 69 days. If the passcode were six characters, even using only lowercase letters, the worst-case delay would be more than 58 years. The company or companies that sign the software would be the ones the FBI needed to persuad When we repeated the attack on a phone that had been turned off and was just starting up, we were asked to reboot the device after 10 failed attempts. After 20 failed attempts and two reboots, Android started a countdown of the failed attempts that would trigger a device wipe. We continued our attack, and at the 30th attempt — as warned on the screen and in the Android documentation — the device performed a “factory reset,” wiping all user data. In contrast to offline attacks, there is a difference between Android and iOS for online brute force attacks. In iOS, both the lock screen and boot process can wipe the user data after a fixed number of failed attempts, but only if the user explicitly enables this. In Android, the boot process always wipes the user data after a fixed number of failed attempts. However, our Nexus 4 device did not allow us to set a limit for lock screen failures. That said, both Android and iOS have options for remote management, which, if enabled, can wipe data after a certain number of failed attempts. The iPhone 5c in the San Bernardino case is owned by the employer of one of the shooters, and has mobile device management (MDM) software installed that lets the company track it and perform other functions on the phone by remote control. Such an MDM app is usually installed as a “Device Administrator” application on an Android phone, and set up using the “Apple Configurator” tool for iOS. We built our own MDM application for our Android phone, and verified that the passcode can be reset without the user’s explicit consent; this also updated the phone’s encryption keys. We could then use the new passcode to unlock the phone from the lock screen and at boot time. (For this attack to work remotely, the phone must be on and have Internet connectivity, and the MDM application must already be programmed to reset the passcode on command from a remote MDM server.) If an attacker needed help from a phone manufacturer or software company, Android presents a more diverse landscape. Generally, operating system software is signed with a digital code that proves it is genuine, and which the phone requires before actually installing it. Only the company with the correct digital code can create an update to the operating system software — which might include a “back door” or other entry point for an attacker who had secured the company’s assistance. For any iPhone, that’s Apple. But many companies build and sell Android phones. Google, the primary developer of the Android operating system, signs the updates for its flagship Nexus devices. Samsung signs for its devices. Cellular carriers (such as AT&T or Verizon) may also sign. And many users install a custom version of Android (such as Cyanogenmod). The company or companies that sign the software would be the ones the FBI needed to persuade — or compel — to write software allowing a way in. Android has a more secure default for online attacks at start-up Overall, devices running the most recent versions of iOS and Android are comparably protected against offline attacks, when configured correctly by both the phone manufacturer and the end user. Older versions may be more vulnerable; one system could be cracked in less than 10 seconds. Additionally, configuration and software flaws by phone manufacturers may also compromise security of both Android and iOS devices. But we found differences for online attacks, based on user and remote management configuration: Android has a more secure default for online attacks at start-up, but our Nexus 4 did not allow the user to set a maximum number of failed attempts from the lock screen (other devices may vary). Devices running iOS have both of these capabilities, but a user must enable them manually in advance. Android security may also be weakened by remote control software, depending on the software used. Though the FBI was unable to gain access to the iPhone 5c by resetting the password this way, we were successful with a similar attack on our Android device.

              "[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Iran’s biggest OPEC rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, are bagging its European oil market share by cranking up production of their lookalike crude grades before the restart of U.S. sanctions designed to halt exports from the Islamic Republic.  Iran faces curbs on its energy sector from early November after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away in May from a 2015 deal aimed at restraining Tehran’s nuclear program.  Iran’s crude is mainly bought by refiners in China, India, Japan and South Korea, although it has customers in Turkey and the European Union. Buyers seeking an alternative cannot simply opt for any crude on the market.   “As oil sanctions against Iran take effect, perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere, maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion,” the International Energy Agency warned recently. [IEA/M]  “Thus, the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today,” the Paris-based IEA said.   A senior Iranian diplomat told producer group OPEC on Aug. 19 that no member country should be allowed to take over another’s share of oil exports, in light of Saudi Arabia’s offer to produce more to cover any Iranian shortfalls.  But a look at trade flows shows that in Europe at least, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have already succeeded in doing so.  Since the start of the year, Iranian flows to Europe have fallen 35 percent to around 415,000 barrels per day (bpd), while Saudi shipments have doubled and those from Iraq have risen 30 percent, according to Reuters flows and ship-tracking data.  “Saudi, Basra, Urals,” one refiner said when asked what crude grades were likely alternatives, the latter two hailing from Iraq and Russia respectively.  Iraq and Saudi Arabia have raised their oil output by a combined 245,000 bpd since the start of the year and cut the official selling prices for their light crudes for customers in Asia.  Iran is the world’s fifth-largest oil exporter and with as much as 1.5 million bpd of supply estimated to be under threat, its customers may be forced to pay handsomely for possible replacements.  Crude oil is categorized mainly according to sulfur content and its density relative to water, or American Petroleum Institute gravity. The denser crude is, the lower its gravity.   Crudes that have an API gravity above 35 degrees are categorized as “light”, while those with API gravity between 25 and 35 degrees are “medium” and below 25 degrees, “heavy”.   The lighter the crude, the easier and cheaper it is to extract and transport and the simpler it is to refine. Heavier crudes, which contain more impurities such as sulfur or metals, require additional processing to recover higher-value products.  Sulfur content is a second key category. A “sweet” crude is one with a sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent, while the sulfur content of a “sour” crude is above this threshold. Sulfur is corrosive and refineries that run more sour grades require more intense maintenance.  The average API for OPEC’s crudes is 33, compared with an average of 35.7 for U.S. grades. Shale, the fastest-growing type of U.S. crude, is lighter still.   (Graphic: Major crude oil grades by type - reut.rs/2OH67XX)  Iran Light is a medium sour crude, meaning that shale, however abundant and cheap, cannot act as a replacement on its own. Most refineries worldwide are tooled to run crudes with an API of 32, according to one source at a major European refiner.  (Graphic: EIA diagram of a conventional oil refinery - reut.rs/2L0yii9)  Refineries regularly blend different types of crude to get as close as possible to their optimal intake.   (Graphic: Major international crude oil grades - reut.rs/2OUtWeI)  The impact on the more sour crudes is already apparent. Prices for physical barrels oil have generally declined over the second half of this year, but Russian Urals, British Forties and Angolan Girassol, all sour, are the top-performing grades from around the Atlantic Basin, having lost around 4 percent.  That compares with losses of 5-6 percent for lighter, sweeter crudes such as Norwegian Ekofisk or Nigeria’s Bonny Light.

              " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures gained on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi crude production unexpectedly fell in July, raising concerns about global oil supplies as the United States prepares to reinstate sanctions against major exporter Iran. Brent crude futures rose 54 cents to settle at $73.75 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 52 cents to settle at $69.01 a barrel. Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two sources at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from June. That came despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a “measurable” supply boost. “Prices had dropped recently assuming that Saudi was going to continue to produce,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York. “If the argument now is that maybe they can’t produce as much as everyone was hoping for, that puts some upward pressure on prices.” Brent prices fell 6.5 percent in July, their steepest monthly drop since July 2016. Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2MlIQtH U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note that “the Saudi and Russian production surges appear to be more limited” than expected, adding that the imminent reinstatement of U.S. sanctions against Iran also fed bullish sentiment. Washington is due to reinstate some sanctions against Iran that it suspended after a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran that sought to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Some of the sanctions resume on Tuesday. The United States also plans to re-introduce sanctions on Iranian oil in November, which could dent the OPEC member’s output. Renewed sanctions are part of the Trump administration’s strategy to deny resources to the Iranian leadership. Washington wants as many countries as possible to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero, a senior U.S. administration official said in a telephone press briefing. But a senior official at Iran’s economy ministry said Tehran did not think the economic impact of the sanctions would be massive. “Many countries, including Europeans, disagree with the U.S. sanctions and are willing to work with Iran,” said the official, who asked not to be named. Most Iranian crude exports go to China and India, but roughly 20 percent go to Europe, where refiners have already cut their purchases. Meanwhile, U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months.

              " '* Trump tweets \\'Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China\\' Oil market oversupply set to stay despite OPEC+ pact -IEA * OPEC sees small 2020 oil deficit even before latest supply cut (Updates prices, market activity, adds commentary; changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 1% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was \"very close\" to nailing down a trade deal with China. Brent crude futures rose 55 cents to $64.27 a barrel by 11:23 a.m. EST (1623 GMT). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 44 cents to $59.20 a barrel. Oil prices received a fresh boost after Trump\\'s tweet saying the United States was \"very close to a big deal with China\" amid reports that the country was considering a delay or possible cancellation of tariffs scheduled to go into effect on Dec. 15. While prices received a fresh boost immediately following the tweet, futures eased somewhat during the session. \"It\\'s tough to draw a firm conclusion from the latest that came out,\" said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. \"It seems to be close, but we\\'ve all been waiting for this deal to happen.\" The outlook for oil demand has been clouded by U.S.-China trade tensions and uncertainty over whether a fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would come into effect. Trump was expected to meet with his top trade advisers on Thursday to discuss the Dec. 15 tariff deadline, sources told Reuters. China\\'s commerce ministry said Beijing and Washington were in close communication, declining to comment on possible retaliatory steps if Trump imposes the extra tariffs. Oil prices have firmed after OPEC and other producers including Russia agreed last week to rein in output by an extra 500,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said this week that it now expected a small oil market deficit in the next year, suggesting the market is tighter than previously thought. By contrast, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted a sharp rise in global inventories despite the OPEC agreement, noting expectations for lower output by the United States and other non-OPEC countries. Oil prices were also supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged at a meeting on Wednesday. The European Central Bank also kept its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, even keeping the door open to more stimulus. \"While oil prices are trending higher benefiting from a dovish Fed, a weaker U.S. dollar, the IEA reiterates that despite the deeper oil production cuts, the oil market is likely to be oversupplied in 1H20,\" said UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

              " 'TOKYO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday with the market mood switching to relief as OPEC forecast a supply deficit next year, from doom and gloom over data showing a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories. Brent futures rose 19 cents, or 0.3% to 63.61 a barrel by 0100 GMT, after skidding 1% on Wednesday on the U.S. stocks build-up. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 9 cents at $58.85 a barrel, following a 0.8% drop the previous session. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Wednesday said it now expected a small deficit in the oil market in the next year, suggesting the market is tighter than previously thought - even before the latest pact with other producers to curb supply takes effect. The revised forecast by OPEC marks a further retreat from a prediction of a glut in 2020 as U.S. production growth begins to slow. Still, U.S. inventories are on the rise. Crude stockpiles last week rose unexpectedly, gaining more than 800,000 barrels, compared with a Reuters poll that forecast a 2.8 million barrel decline. Inventories of petroleum products also increased with gasoline stocks surging by more than 5 million barrels and distillates gaining a bit over 4 million barrels - with both more than double expectations. “The overall report was very bearish as demand fell off a cliff and total stockpiles climbed to the highest level in seven months,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Beyond the balance between inventories and supply, investors are also awaiting news on negotiations between Washington and Beijing to end a long-running trade war and get an agreement before another round of U.S. sanctions kicks in. The lingering battle between the world’s two biggest economies has hit global growth, in the process denting demand for crude and oil products. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to discuss tariffs on Chinese goods set to be imposed on Dec. 15 with top trade advisers as markets brace for fallout in China’s reaction.

              " 'SEOUL, June 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday after falling nearly 2 percent in the previous session, but growing U.S. production and expectations of higher OPEC supplies continue to weigh on sentiment. Brent crude futures added 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $75.44 a barrel at 0020 GMT, after settling down 2 percent at $75.29 a barrel on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $65.03 a barrel. It finished the previous session 1.6 percent lower at $64.75 a barrel. “It’s all about supply, whether it’s OPEC raising output or U.S. increasing production, all roads lead to higher global oil supplies, which is leaving oil traders shaking in their boots,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide whether the group and non-OPEC members including Russia will raise production to ease concerns over potential supply shortfalls from Iran and Venezuela. Over the weekend, OPEC and non-OPEC Arab oil ministers agreed on the need for continued cooperation to balance global supply, Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA reported. Increasing U.S. crude oil production has also put pressure on oil prices. In March, U.S. crude output rose to 10.47 million barrels per day, the highest on record, according to a monthly report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The number of rigs drilling in the United States was also up by two in the week to June 1, bringing the total to 861, the most since 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services said on Friday. Industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to release its data for last week’s U.S. crude oil inventories at 2030 GMT on Tuesday, and the EIA report is scheduled at 1430 GMT on Wednesday. U.S. crude stocks were forecast to fall about 2.5 million barrels on average in the week ended June 1, according to five analysts polled ahead of the reports.

              " '* U.S. crude stocks fall 1.7 mln bbls -EIA * OPEC, allies to mull deeper production cuts * Weak demand growth outlook weighs on sentiment * Goldman Sachs sees Brent prices around $60/bbl in 2020 (Updates with settlement prices) By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Oil rose about 2.5% on Wednesday after government data showed a surprise draw in U.S. crude stocks and as the prospect of deeper output cuts by OPEC and its allies offered support. U.S. crude stocks fell 1.7 million barrels last week as refineries hiked crude runs by 429,000 barrels per day (bpd) and oil imports fell, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts had expected an increase of 2.2 million barrels. Brent crude futures settled at $61.17 a barrel, up $1.47, or 2.5%. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.49, or 2.7%, to end at $55.97 a barrel. Oil prices had fallen earlier in the session after data on Tuesday from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks rising more than analysts’ expectations, by 4.5 million barrels to 437 million barrels. The EIA’s report “has put some buyers in the market, but it will be interesting to see if it lasts. While this will distract from demand destruction, the market will eventually come back to it,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The draw in U.S. oil stocks appeared to have been caused by temporary market factors including higher refinery runs, rather than a fundamental firming of oil demand, and investors are still concerned about the global economy following reports of slowing growth in China and Europe, McGillian added. A larger-than-expected decline in U.S. gasoline stocks and lower net oil imports also supported prices, analysts said. Gasoline stocks fell by 3.1 million barrels, compared with analysts expectations of a 2.3 million-barrel drop. “The continued decline in product inventory makes for a bullish report,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. “Gasoline numbers are summer-like; that’s endemic of a good economy (in the U.S.) and people driving to work.” Net U.S. crude imports fell by 873,000 bpd to the lowest on record, while exports rose 435,000 bpd to a near record 3.7 million bpd, the data showed. “No one really saw that coming because it came at a time when shipping rates were adding a considerable premium to the barrel,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. Also helping to underpin prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is mulling whether to deepen production cuts amid concerns of weak demand growth next year. OPEC and other oil producers including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, have pledged to cut production by 1.2 million bpd until March 2020. OPEC and other non-members are scheduled to meet again Dec. 5-6. “With the headwinds of strong U.S. producer hedging and high freight rates fading, we expect stronger Brent timespreads and higher prices in coming weeks, with upside risk to our year-end $62 per barrel forecast,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. The investment bank expects Brent prices to continue trading around $60 a barrel in 2020. (Additional reporting by Ron Bousso and Koustav Samanta; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Steve Orlofsky)',\n",
              " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose about 1% on Friday after attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman this week raised concerns about potential supply disruptions, but prices remained on track for a weekly loss on fears that trade disputes will dent global oil demand.  Brent futures settled 70 cents, or 1.1%, higher at $62.01 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 23 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $52.51.  The attacks on oil tankers near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz pushed up oil prices by as much as 4.5% on Thursday.   It was the second time in a month tankers have been attacked in the world’s most important zone for oil supplies as tensions increase between the United States and Iran. Washington blamed Iran for Thursday’s attacks, prompting a denial and criticism from Tehran.  On Friday, a U.S. official said Iranian military fast-boats in the Gulf of Oman were preventing two privately-owned tug boats from towing away one of the damaged tankers.  “The possibility of what we’ve seen (in the Middle East) over the past few days could intensify into the weekend and traders are reluctant to be short in front of that,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, noting “The recent headline of restricting those tug boats got some traders off the fence to cover shorts.”  Still, Brent registered a weekly decline of around 2%, putting it down for a fourth week in a row, while U.S. crude lost almost 3%.  “The deteriorating demand outlook is holding back prices, despite these tensions,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Slowing economic conditions have eaten into demand growth, overshadowing ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Kilduff said. As a result, prices may be stuck in a holding pattern. “We are stalemated here.”  The International Energy Agency cut its demand growth forecast for 2019 by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.2 million bpd, citing worsening prospects for world trade.   However, the Paris-based agency said it expects demand growth to climb to 1.4 million bpd in 2020.    On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its 2019 forecast for growth in global oil demand even lower than the IEA, to 1.14 million bpd.  On the supply side, U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, an output cut pact by OPEC plus its allies, fighting in Libya and attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman added only limited uncertainty to supply, the IEA said.  Surging U.S. supply, as well as gains from Brazil, Canada and Norway, would contribute to an increase in non-OPEC supply of 1.9 million bpd this year and 2.3 million bpd in 2020.  U.S. energy firms reduced the number of oil rigs operating for a second week in a row, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. [RIG/U]  Graphic: Position of evacuated tankers in Gulf of Oman (tmsnrt.rs/2X6nIQF)  Tensions in the Middle East have escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 multinational nuclear pact with Iran and reimposed sanctions, especially targeting Tehran’s oil exports.  Iran, which has distanced itself from the previous attacks, has said it will not be cowed by what it describes as psychological warfare.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has assessed that Iran was behind the attacks on Thursday.  The U.S. military later released a video that it said showed Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from the side of a Japanese-owned oil tanker.

              " 'New York (CNN Business)US oil prices raced above $65 a barrel on Monday for the first time since Halloween after the White House pledged to deepen its crackdown on Iran. The Trump administration vowed to bring Iran\\'s oil exports to \"zero\" by removing the waivers that previously allowed some countries to buy crude from the OPEC nation. The escalation adds to mounting supply concerns in the oil market. Venezuela\\'s oil shipments have been wiped out by US sanctions. Violence is rocking Libya. And Saudi Arabia has slashed its output. \"The market will be under pressure and the prices will definitely react upward,\" said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at consulting firm Facts Global Energy. President Donald Trump promised in a tweet that \"Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up\" the difference.  The oil market, however, signaled skepticism. Oil is up 54% since Christmas Eve lows US oil prices climbed nearly 3% on Monday to $65.70 a barrel. That represents a spike of 54% since prices closed at $42.53 a barrel on Christmas Eve. Brent crude, the global benchmark, surged nearly 3% on Monday and touched $74 for the first time since early November. Gasoline prices, meanwhile, continued to climb. The national average hit $2.84 a gallon on Monday, up from $2.61 a month ago, according to AAA. \"It\\'s a bit of a conundrum,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, an energy research firm. \"We know President Trump wants to keep gasoline prices in check. But oil prices are gaining and that will only drag that retail gasoline price higher.\" Trump first announced sanctions on Iran a year ago. Oil prices initially shot higher due to fears about the loss of supply from Iran, which was then the world\\'s fifth-biggest producer of crude. Saudi Arabia responded by ramping up production to all-time highs. However, the US administration, fearing an oil shock that would cripple the economy, granted waivers to China, India and six other nations. The softer-than-expected approach left oil markets oversupplied, contributing to last fall\\'s bear market in crude. The White House announced on Monday that Trump decided he will not reissue the Iran waivers when they expire in early May. The move is aimed at blocking the Iranian regime from its No. 1 source of cash. \"We\\'re going to zero, across the board,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a press conference.  Iran\\'s exports tumble  Iran exported about 1.4 million barrels of crude a day in March, down by half from pre-sanctions levels, according to the International Energy Agency. And Iran\\'s output is sitting at its lowest level in nearly six years, the IEA said.  Some nations have already weaned themselves off Iran\\'s oil. Italy, Greece and Taiwan haven\\'t loaded any Iranian barrels since November, the IEA said, citing Kpler shipping data.  However, China, Japan, Korea and Turkey have imported more oil from Iran than their waivers allowed them to, the IEA said. \"It\\'s hard to see the exports go to zero. But you may roughly lose about half of it,\" said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise. He said China is unlikely to completely cease imports from Iran. The good news for American drivers is that the United States is pumping more oil than ever before. In fact, America is now the world\\'s leading oil producer.  That domestic production, which is expected to keep rising, provides a cushion against the situations in Iran and Venezuela. \"The United States is now a significant producer,\" Pompeo said on Monday. However, not all crude is created equally. US shale oil is much lighter than the heavy barrels knocked offline in Iran and Venezuela. US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to run on a healthy dose of heavy crude. A shortage of those heavy barrels would make it difficult for refiners to produce as much gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as America\\'s economy requires.  Saudis voice support The Trump administration announced on Monday that the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are \"committed to ensuring that global oil markets remain adequately supplied.\" \"We have agreed to take timely action to assure that global demand is met,\" the White House said in a statement. However, no specifics were announced. Pompeo declined to go into details on any such agreement. Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia\\'s energy minister, said in a separate statement that the kingdom will coordinate with other oil producers \"to ensure the availability of enough oil supplies for consumers and to ensure global oil markets are not knocked off balance.\" The end of the OPEC deal? If Saudi Arabia wants to help, it would have to reverse its own recent moves. Facing a collapse in oil prices, OPEC and its allies agreed in December to slash production. Saudi Arabia, OPEC\\'s de facto leader, delivered the brunt of the output cuts.  Nasseri, the analyst from Facts Global Energy, said that Saudi Arabia and the UAE could potentially replace up to 1 million barrels per day lost because of the crackdown on Iran. However, such a move would eat into the ability of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to respond to future supply shocks.  \"They will end up having very little spare capacity left for any other emergency or any other crisis in the oil market,\" Nasseri said.  US imports from Venezuela have plunged to zero because of the sanctions Trump imposed earlier this year on PDVSA, the Latin American nation\\'s state-owned oil company.  OPEC and its allies will need to decide next steps when they meet in Vienna in June. \"They will have a very tough OPEC meeting,\" Nasseri said. \"That may be the end of the OPEC-plus agreement in its current format.\" -- CNN Business\\' Zahraa Alkhalisi contributed to this report.',\n",
              " \"Crude oil can go even higher after it spiked above $70 per barrel Tuesday for the first time since May. The latest jump came after the State Department ordered allies to halt their imports from Iran by November. This tightens supply heading into the second half of the year and into 2019; given these conditions, the door is now open to $80 per barrel. I've been bullish on crude oil leading into this move and believe pullbacks toward the $67 mark should be bought and investors can utilize puts to protect against downside risk. Last week, oil rallied hard into week’s end as OPEC met in Vienna and announced on Friday it would raise production by 1 million barrels per day. The price action even got a bit ahead of itself, with a gain of nearly 5 percent. Several members are unable to add output, and that means only something in the ballpark of an additional half a million barrels per day will actually come online next month. While there are some short-term concerns around rising production both from OPEC and U.S. shale, along with trade war-associated risk, the long-term story is bullish. Rising demand and the most recent order from the State Department are two positive catalysts. Furthermore, Saudi’s oil minister pointed to a potential deficit of 1.8 million barrels per day in the second half of this year. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

              " '(Adds quote, background) March 16 (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday frequent U.S. comments about oil prices had created market tensions, the ministry\\'s news website SHANA reported. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made the U.S. economy one of his top issues, has repeatedly tweeted about oil prices and the Organization of the Petroleum Producing Countries. He has expressed concern about higher prices, including last month and ahead of OPEC\\'s meeting in December. \"Americans talk a lot and I advise them to talk less. They (have) caused tensions in the oil market for over a year now and they are responsible for it, and if this trend continues, the market will be more tense,\" SHANA quoted Zanganeh as saying. U.S. crude futures briefly hit a 2019 high on Friday but later retreated along with benchmark Brent oil as worries about the global economy and robust U.S. production put a brake on prices. OPEC and its allies including Russia, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed last year to cut production, partly in response to increased U.S. shale output. \"We do not know whether U.S. waivers would be extended or not, we will do our job but they (the U.S.) say something new every single day,\" Zanganeh said. Washington granted waivers to eight major buyers of Iranian oil after reimposing sanctions on Iran\\'s oil sector in November, after withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
